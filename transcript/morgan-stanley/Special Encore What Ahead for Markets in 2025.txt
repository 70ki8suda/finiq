 2024 was a year of transition for economies and global markets. Central banks began easing interest rates, US elections, signaled significant policy change, and generative AI made a quantum leap in adoption and development. Thank you for listening throughout 2024, as we navigated the issues and events that shaped financial markets and society. We hope you'll join us next year as we continue to bring you the most up-to-date information on the financial world. This week, please enjoy some on-course of episodes over the last few months and we'll be back with all new episodes in January. From all of us at Thoughts in the Market, Happy Holidays, and a very happy New Year. Welcome to Thoughts on the Market. I'm Vishit Rupathor, Moghastali's Chief Fixed Income Strategist. Today in the podcast, we are hosting a special roundtable discussion on what's ahead for the global economy and markets in 2025. I'm joined by my colleagues, Seth Carpenter, Global Chief Economist, Mike Wilson, Chief US Equity Strategist, and the firm's Chief Investment Officer, and Andrew Sheed's Global Head of Great Research. It's Monday, November 18th at 10am in New York. Gentlemen, thank you all for taking the time to talk. We have a lot to cover and so I'm going to go right into it. Seth, I want to start with the global economy. As you look ahead to 2025, how do you see the global economy evolving in terms of growth, inflation, and monetary policy? I have to say, it's always difficult to do forecasts, but I think right now the uncertainty is even greater than usual. It's pretty tricky. I think if you do it at a global level, we're not actually looking for all that much of a change, you know, around 3-ish percent growth, but the composition is surely going to change some. So let's hit the big economies around the world. For the US, we are looking for a bit of a slowdown. Now, some of that was unsustainable growth this year and last year. There's a bit of waning residual impetus from fiscal policy that's going to come off in growth rate terms. Monetary policy is still restrictive and there's some lags effect there. So even though the Fed is cutting rates, there's still going to be a little bit of a slowdown coming next year from that. But I think the really big question you alluded to this in your question is what about other policy changes here for fiscal policy? We think that's really an issue for 2026. That's when the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, Tax Cuts expire, and so we think there's going to be a fix for that, but that's going to take most of 2025 to address legislatively. And so the fiscal impetus really is a question for 2026. But immigration tariffs, those matter a lot. And here, the question really is, do things get front-loaded? Is it everything all at once right at the beginning? Is it phased in over time? A bit like it was over 2018? I think our baseline assumption is that there will be tariffs. There will be an increase in tariffs, especially on China, but they will get phased in over the course of 2025. And so as a result, the first thing you see is some increase in inflation, and it will build as the tariffs build. The slowdown from growth up gets backloaded to the end of 2025, and then really spills over into 2026. Now, Europe is still in a situation where they've got some sluggish growth. We think things stabilize. We get 1% growth or so. So not a further deterioration there, but not a huge increase that would make you super excited. The ECB should probably keep cutting interest rates. And we actually think there's a really good chance that inflation in the Euro area goes below their target. And so as a result, what do we see? Well, the ECB cutting down below their best gets of neutral. They think 2% nominal is neutral, and they go below that. China is another big curveball here for the forecast because they've been in this debt deflation spiral for a while. We don't think the pivot in fiscal policy is anywhere near sufficient to work things off. And so we could actually see a further slowing down of growth in China in 2025, as the policy makers do this reactive kind of policy response. And so it's going to take a while there, and we think there's a downside risk there. On the upside, I mean, we're still bullish on Japan. We're still very bullish on India and its growth. And across other parts of EM, there's some bright spots. So it's a real mixed bag. I don't think there's a single trend across the globe that's going to drive you overall growth narrative. Thank you, Seth. Mike, I'd like to go to you next. 2024 has turned out to be a strong year for equity markets globally, particularly for US and Japanese equities. While we did see modest earnings growth, equity returns were mostly about multiple expansion. How do you expect 2025 to turn out for the global equity markets? What are the key challenges and opportunities ahead for the equity markets that you see? Yeah, this year was interesting because we had what I would say was very modest earnings growth in the US in particular relative to the performance. It was really all multiple expansion. And that's probably not going to repeat. This year we're looking for better earnings growth given our soft landing outcome from an economic standpoint and rates coming down. But we don't think multiples will expand any further. In fact, we think they'll come down by about 5 percent, but that still gets us a decent return in the base case of high single digits. Japan is the second market we like relative to the rest of the world because of the corporate governance story. So there are two. We're looking for high single digit earnings growth and high single digits or 10 percent return in total. And Europe is one where we're down taking a bit because of tariff risk and also pressure from China where they have a lot of export business. The challenges I think going forward is that growth continues to be below trend in many regions. The second challenge is that high quality assets are expensive everywhere. It's not just the US. It's sort of everywhere in the world. So you get what you pay for. The S&P is extremely expensive, but that's because the RWE is higher and growth is higher. So in other words, these are not well kept secrets. And so just valuation is a real challenge. And then of course the consensus views are generally fairly narrow around the soft landing and that's very price as well. So the risks are that the consensus view doesn't play out. And that's why we have two bull and two bear cases in the US just like we did in the mid year outlook. And in fact, what happened is one of our bull cases is what played out in the second half of this year. So the real opportunity from our standpoint, I think it's a global call as well, which is that we continue to think there's going to be pretty big rotations around the macro outlook, which remains uncertain. Given the policy changes we're seeing in the US potentially. And also the geopolitical risk that still is out there. And then the other big opportunities been stock picking dispersion is extremely high. Client are really being rewarded for taking single stock exposures. And I think that continues into next year. So we're going to do what we did this year is we're going to try to rotate around from a style and size perspective, depending on the macro outlook. Thank you, Mike. Andrew, we are ending 2024 in a reasonably good setup for create markets, with spreads at or near multi decade tights for many markets. How do you expect the global create markets to play out in 2025? What are the best places to be between the create spectrum and across different regions? I think that's the best way to defram it, to start a little bit about where we are and then talk about where we might be going. I think it's safe to say that this has been an absolutely phenomenal backdrop for corporate credit. Corporate credit likes moderation. And I think you've seen an unusual amount of moderation at both the macro and the micro level. You've seen kind of moderate growth, moderating inflation, moderating policy rates across DM. And then at the micro level, even though markets have been very strong, corporate aggressiveness has not been. M&A has been well below trend. Corporate balance sheets have been pretty stable. So what I think is notable is you've had an economic backdrop that credit has really liked as you correctly note, we've pushed spreads near 20 year tights based on that backdrop. But it's a backdrop that credit markets liked, but US voters did not like and they voted for different policy. And so when we look ahead, the range of outcomes, I think across both the macro and the micro is expanding. And I think the policy uncertainty that markets now face is increasing both scenarios to the upside where things are hotter and you see more animal spirits and risks to the downside, where potentially more aggressive tariffs or action on immigration creates more kind of stagflationary types of risks. So one element that we're facing is we feel like we're leaving behind a really good environment for corporate credit and we're entering something that's more uncertain. But then balancing that is that you're not going to transition immediately. You still have a lot of momentum in the US and European economy. With an eye look at the forecast from Seth's team, the global economic numbers or at least kind of the DM economic numbers into the first half of next year still look fine. We still have the Fed cutting, we still have the ECB cutting, we still have inflation moderating. So part of our thinking for this year is it could be a little bit of a story of two halves that we titled our section on borrowed time that the credit is still likely to hold in well and perform better in the first half of the year. Yeels are still good, the Fed is still cutting. The backdrop hasn't changed that much. And then it's the second half of the year where some of our economic numbers start to show more divergence where the Fed is no longer cutting rates, where all in yield levels are lower on our interest rate forecast, which could temper demand. That looks somewhat trickier. In terms of how we think about what we like within credit, we do think the levered loan market continues to be attractive. That's part of credit where spreads are not particularly tight versus history. That's one area where we still see risk premium. I think this is also an environment where regionally we see Asia underperforming. It's a market that's both very expensive from a spread perspective, but also faces potentially kind of outsized economic and tariff uncertainty. And we think that the US might outperform in context to at least initially investors feeling like the US is at less relative risks from tariffs and policy uncertainty than some other markets. So with this, I'll pause there and pass it back to you. Thanks, Mike. Seth in Andrew. Thank you all for listening. We're going to take a pause here.
