What about the outlook into 2025? Here's Bloomberg Equities reporter Alexandra Seminova. For the most part analysts are optimistic about next year. They think that we'll chug along along a little more slowly than we have for the last couple of years. But the economy is still doing well. Consumers are still spending. We expect the federal reserve to continue easing policy as long as inflation doesn't resurface. Companies are expected to grow their earnings. Of course the AI momentum is still intact and after spending so much on AI this year we're going to see some of that monetized next year. So that should bode well for the outlook into 2025. Bloomberg's Alexandra Seminova. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 1-10th of 1 percent higher by 28 points. The S&P 500 index little changed down two points, down less than 1-10th of 1 percent.

Are you feeling tapped out on political news after all the twists and turns of the 2024 campaign? If so, you are far from the only ones we hear from Bloomberg's Nathan Hager in Washington. A poll taken this month by the Associated Press and the National Opinion Research Center finds about two and three adults in this country are dialing back media consumption on politics and government just because of overload. 7-10 Democrats say they are scaling back while 6-10 Republicans say they're taking time off from news coverage as well. The ratings may bear that out. MSNBC's Primetime Audience has plunged 54 percent since the election. CNN's is down 45 percent. While Fox News Channel, a favorite of fans of President-elect Trump, has seen its viewership jump by 13 percent. In Washington, I'm Nathan Hager, Bloomberg Radio.

People who think about climate change and people who are doing something about it. On the Zero Podcast, we talk to both kinds of people. People you've heard of, like Bill Gates.
