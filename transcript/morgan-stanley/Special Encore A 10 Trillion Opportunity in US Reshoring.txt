From all of us at Thoughts in the Market, Happy Holidays, and a very happy New Year. Welcome to Thoughts on the Market. I'm Chris Snyder, Morgan Stanley's US Multine District Analyst. Today, I'll discuss the far-reaching implications of shifting industrial production back to the United States. It's Friday, October 25th at 10am in New York. Global manufacturing is undergoing a seismic shift, and the United States is at the epicenter of this transformation. After decades of offshoreing and relying on international supply chains, the pendulum is swinging back towards domestic production. This movement, known as re-shoring, is not just a fleeting trend, but a strategic realignment of manufacturing capabilities that is indicative of the multi-polar theme playing out globally. In fact, we believe the US is entering the early innings of re-industrialization, a multi-decked opportunity that we size at $10 trillion and think has the potential to restore growth to the US industrial economy following more than 20 years of stagnation. The re-shoring of manufacturing to the US is fueled by a combination of factors that are making domestic production both viable and lucrative. While the initial sparks were ignited by policy changes, including tariffs and trade agreements, the COVID-19 pandemic laid bare the risk of elongated supply chains and overdependence on foreign manufacturing. Meanwhile, the diffusion of cutting-edge technology such as automation, artificial intelligence, and advanced robotics has diminished the cost advantages of low-wage countries. The US, with its robust tech sector and innovation ecosystem, is uniquely positioned to leverage technology to revitalize its manufacturing base. Who are the direct beneficiaries? High tech sectors, such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and advanced manufacturing systems are likely to be the biggest winners. Traditional industrial sectors such as automotive and aerospace are also seeing a resurgence. Finally, companies that invest in more sustainable manufacturing processes stand to gain from both policy-driven incentives and growing market demand. All told, these businesses should see shorter supply chains, reduce legal and tariff costs, and a more resilient operational structure. As for the broader US economy, we think the implications are pretty profound. In all during the US industrial landscape, re-shoring promises not only to boost GDP growth, but it could also stabilize and potentially reverse the trade deficits that have plagued the US economy for years.
