As you mentioned earlier, that hawkish cut by the Fed as expected, Fed officials lowering their benchmark interest rate for a third consecutive time reigned in the number of cuts they expect in 2025, signaling greater caution over how quickly they can continue reducing borrowing costs. Here's Fed, Chair Jay Powell earlier at today's press conference. I think that the lower pace of cuts for next year really reflects both the higher inflation readings we've had this year and the expectation inflation will be higher. You saw in the SEP that risks and uncertainty around inflation we see as higher. Nonetheless, we see ourselves as still on track to continue to cut. Okay, then of course, this Fed, Chair Jay Powell at today's press conference. Let's get into the Fed decision. Michael Rosen is with us. He's Chief Investment Officer at Angelus Wealth Management. They've got more than 40 billion in assets under advisement and 6.4 billion in assets under management. Michael joining us from Sunny and Warm Santa Monica, California. Kind of different here. It's warm here, but it's rainy. Here in our Bloomberg and Director, Broker Studio is Ira Jersey, Bloomberg Intelligence Chief US Interest Rate Strategist. I want to start with you, that hawkish rate cut that we were expecting, safe to say we got it. Yeah, we got it. But the market clearly wasn't fully priced for it because otherwise, we wouldn't be selling off 10 basis points in 10-year yields. These are big moves. Yeah, these aren't massively large in recent times, but they're at the same time if we were fully priced for it, we wouldn't certainly be seeing a 10 basis point move. Where we do see things that we were talking about this before we went on air, is you look at the pricing for what the Fed's terminal rate is going to be, and we're now pricing only for about another 30-ish basis points, 35 basis points of interest. So a little bit more than one move? Exactly. So not very much. That suggests that the market still thinks that in the market does overshoot sometimes, right? But at the same time, the market's now thinking, hey, maybe the Fed is seeing what we're seeing, and that's that the economy's okay, and they're going to cut one more time maybe in March, and then they'll be done. So Ira, what specifically in your view did traders here today from Fed Chair Jay Powell that caused them to say, wait a second, we're not going to get as many cuts, apart from the summary of economic projections, but the terminal rate could be just shy of... Well, he said that they can move cautiously, like that was actually in the prepared remarks, right? So there's a difference, right? There's the prepared remarks, which are something that, you know, they obviously prepare beforehand, and we see those right too. Yeah, and you get it, well, no, no, you get it at 230, right? So he reads them at 230, and then we get the... Those 78 minutes of remarks he makes before the... Correct. And it's basically the statement that you get at 2 o'clock expanded, right? Okay. It gives you more detail of what's in... what they were talking about, what they were thinking, and the like. So that's important because that's like the whole committee's view. Then when you start to get into the Q&A, that's much more J-Pow, right? And sometimes he's talking about for the committee, and sometimes he's talking maybe a little bit more... Sometimes he's talking about some people? Yeah, well, exactly. And... Did you reference which I thought was interesting? Correct, and we did have a dissent today, right? Right. So we did have a dissent... A new member. A hawkish dissent. I mean, you remember... I knew it. This was the first time for... Anyway, yeah. I wouldn't worry about that. I know we're making a lot of... But yeah, but... We got Ira here to keep us in mind. So... But masks are not exactly... I think that that person took the sword basically for probably two or three other people who also didn't want to cut today, right? Because a lot of times what happens at the Fed, and if you talk to former Fed governors and Fed presidents, they'll tell you, like, one person dissenting probably means it's really two to four, you know, or don't like it, but they kind of go along with it anyway, just so it doesn't seem like the whole committee's out of whack. Michael Rosen, come on in on this. Forgive us. We just kind of digging down with Ira here. But is this a market with the selling that we're seeing? Do you... I don't know, rethink the outlook here in terms of equity positions? Or do you say, hey, some of those names that we're getting a little expensive, valuations high, it's actually a buying opportunity. What's your thinking on this? Well, Carol, good to be with you. I actually think Ira has the right point. I think the market was priced to be more bullish, perhaps then actually it turned out to be. And we knew we would have a hawkish cut in race, but again, I think the market maybe was just a little bit too euphoric coming into this, and that's why maybe we're seeing the sell-off. And you're seeing it in the areas that are much more interest rate sensitive, like real estate and consumer discretionary, for example. So, do you buy on this? Are you saying that these are opportunities? Do you say, well, wait a minute, this is a bit of a reset. And so maybe a different environment for equities going forward. Yeah, I really don't think it's a reset. I think actually the bond market has been behind the curve, not the equity market. The economy is strong, wages are up, incomes are up, profits are at record levels, and profits are really what drive equity markets over time. So, as long as profits are holding in and they are, with a strong economy, we just saw, with ease that happened today, every indication suggests to me that profits will remain on an upward trajectory, and that is still bullish for equities. I think I would focus on areas that are generating the profits. And those have been, those are the big tech companies, the big platform companies that generate tremendous amounts of cash in profits. And those have been the leaders, and I think those will continue to be the leaders, as long as the profits remain strong. The areas that are more interest rate sensitive are going to be disappointed, with the economy strong, with inflation, that has come down, but not nearly enough, and in fact it's probably on the rise at this point, interest rates are going to have to move higher. So anything interest rate sensitive is going to be facing a headwind. All right, so unfortunately I've got about a minute left here. So saving 30, 40 seconds for you, Ira. So what's kind of, I don't know, like how do you think about, do we all just pack up and just wait until 2025, or what's your next focal point here? Well, I think, you know, 4.5%, 4.49 if you want to get really, wonky is a very important technical level for 10-year treasury yields. So we break that, the next big level is 4.7%. Right, so if we break right where we are now, you could wind up seeing a pretty large kind of follow-on move, stops getting hit, and you could wind up seeing some more volatility in the rate market in a hurry. Michael saved actually 15 seconds for you. So now do we start thinking about the next earnings, and I was just going to pull up JP Morgan, dare I say, January 15th, earnings, the next focal point, just really quickly. Yeah, absolutely. That'll, once we get into the latter half of January, we'll start seeing the earnings come out, and that will be the bell weather. I think you're going to have to move higher from here, though. All right, Michael Rosen, thank you so much, and of course, our own Ira Jersey guys. Thank you so much.

Not everybody likes talking about money. Some people find it awkward. Sometimes they find it a little embarrassing. I do not. I like talking about money. Whether it's the boardroom, the newsroom, the trading floor, I've spent the last 30 years talking about money, writing about money, and talking about it, and writing about it a little bit more. I'm Erin Somsetworth, and every week senior reporter John Stappick and I answer your questions about personal finance, and we discuss the best strategies for making the most of your money. Listen up for the kind of insights and explanations everyone can use to help them make better, saving, and investment choices for themselves and their families. My question is whether you think maxing out my company pension match is enough for when it comes to saving for my pension. Should I attempt to pay my child's university fees and living costs? My partner and I have access savings, so should we overpay on our mortgage or should we put the money into stocks? From Bloomberg podcasts, Juninton Merrin talks money, for the Merrin talks money on Apple podcasts, but a vote or wherever you listen. We're all in on the Fed today. Bank Stock sensitive to monetary policy moves really getting hit in a big way. I'm looking at the KBW bank index, falling down to its biggest one-day drop in four months. I'm just checking, is that the close down for a whole person? Yeah, that's at the close, down 4.3%. Yeah, because it looks like it's continuing to drop, I think, in the aftermarket. Just, I think, I think it's going to be a good deal. I think it's going to be a good deal. I think it's going to be a good deal. I think, in the aftermarket, just, yeah. That's not surprising, given what we heard from Trump just now, and also concerns maybe that the sell-off continues into tomorrow's session. It's a really good point, right? I mean, just kind of layering more and more stuff. We should put out shares of the publicly held, New Jersey-based Connect One Bank Core, which is the parent company of Connect One Bank, it too, not surprisingly, like a lot of other names, a lot of banking names, getting hit. Let me just pull up the close down 7% in today's session. We should point out that the bank has 9.89 billion in assets, counts small businesses, and construction companies, among its customers. It's why we always love to check in with Frank Sorentino. He's chairman and CEO of Connect One Bank Core, and he joins us from Englewood, Clevs, New Jersey. The company has about a $911 million market cap company. Frank, good to see you. What stands out for you today in today's Fed decision? Your stock, like most bank stocks, getting hammered, the whole market really across the board, is there something ominous coming? So great to be back with you, Carol. And I find it always fascinating that good news brings negative markets, right? So a stronger economy and a place where people are doing well and strong employment and all the other things that define a more robust economy and the market sells off. So certainly, I don't think there was any surprise to today's Fed action. Interest rates being lowered by 25 basis points, some rhetoric around future cuts not being as much as the market wanted. And I think that's what really drove a lot of the sell off today. And so there was a lot of enthusiasm and optimism, certainly in the banking system, about much lower interest rates. Well, that's not really going to happen. On the flip side, I think we're going to start to see potentially a steepening yield curve for banks. And so ultimately, I think it will be a good thing. So one reason we like to talk to you, and I know Carol's got some questions about bank, net interest margin and stuff. But I want to go right to your clients, because one reason we love talking to you, and if people were paying attention to you, gosh, any time in the last two years when you've been on our program, then they wouldn't be surprised at how good the economy has been over the last couple of years. Because you repeatedly were beating that drum, saying, the companies that are lending with us, the companies that are our customers, the small businesses, the construction companies, they are doing well right now. How are they doing compared to over the last two years for you? Look, I think I've said this before. What we are seeing today, we are still in quite a robust economy. The vast majority of our clients are reporting good news. Is there some normalization going on within the economy today? From all the post-COVID, the monetary policy, the expansion of the Fed balance sheet, with equity in the system, sure. Is that all beginning to normalize? And we're getting to a more consistent with historical norms relative to interest rates and growth rates and everything else. Yes, that's happening. Is anyone really saying that the economy is weak today? I don't see it. People are still, our clients are still saying it is difficult to hire staff today. People are demanding more money. Supplies cost more. There is a little bit of inflation still in within the economy. But certain things are beginning to level off. Rents are beginning to level off a bit. Potentially housing prices are reaching a point where they're becoming, I don't want to say, unaffordable, but they're certainly reaching that, that the edge of people's affordability spectrum. Interest rates are playing a role there. There's been a lot of desire to see interest rates come down a bit. I don't think it's going to happen. I think we are in a very strong cycle. And I think it's going to continue. Certainly, if you think about everything that we're talking about doing in this next administration, these things all have some inflationary component. So we are going to see a strong economy first. So in my opinion, as far as the I can say. So Frank, then why did the Fed cut rates, which is the kind of the question I think are Mike McKee has. I feel like this is the five-year-old to J-Pow. Why? So why? So why? Why cut rates? If the economy is robust, like you say. Look, I think the data that the Fed is looking at, they're looking in longer term segments of time. And they have a what they want to get to, which is a neutral rate. And I think this is part of their program to get there. I don't serve on the Fed, so I don't know for sure. I don't know exactly what they did they're looking at. But clearly, they're seeing signs that they can get to a certain point in the interest rate curve on the short end that meets with the program that they believe brings us full employment, low inflation, and gets the economy to continue to move on. You have to say, they've done a pretty good job up until now. I don't know that anybody should have been surprised by today's action, but I understand the point like why lower rates. But I don't think it's a month-by-month decision. I think these are decisions that they make with a bigger period of time in mind. Well, people clearly surprised, given the equity market reaction and the bond market reaction. Hey, one thing we wanted you to weigh in on is the political environment, which we know that CEOs don't love to do, but this is the world we live in. We just learned that President-Lectonal Trump said he is opposed to the proposed short-term government funding bill that has just been floated by Congress, this, according to Fox News, who cited a conversation with Trump. What does that mean to you? And what does the, you know, another four years of Donald Trump mean to you, given what we learned about him 2017 to 2021? How are you preparing for it? Well, again, I think we're, I try to look at the economy. I try to look at our clients. I try to look at how these things are going to impact them and the only thing that concerns me about things like we heard today is creating a level of uncertainty. And, you know, the one thing that business and the economy really wants is certainty. They want to understand where things are headed, how can they make plans, and how can they go about running their lives, running their businesses, and whenever there's any level of uncertainty and, you know, talking about the federal budget and whether we're going to fund or not, and whether people are going to get paid, you know, government employees, that creates uncertainty, and that's generally just not good. Hey, just get about a minute left. So how frustrating is that for you? You've got to make decisions. I mean, you guys expanded your reach. Last time we talked with you in September, we talked about that. So you're growing, but I mean, how hesitant are you to do things because you're not quite sure the policy that's going to come from this White House and got about 30, 40 seconds? You know what? Whether it's this administration or any other administration, I look at, you know, what's going on on the ground, and I am very bullish about what I see, certainly in our market area, certainly around what we're doing here as a nation. We are the greatest nation on the planet. We live in one of the greatest parts of the nation. I'm very bullish about our economy. And so I make those decisions, and, you know, we all here connect one, make those decisions based on what our clients are telling us and what their needs are. And so we feel pretty good about where things have been. Yeah, as you said, I've been saying the same thing for the last couple of years. And where things are going? Are you as robust in your outlook as you were three months ago, part of the election? And again, just got about 10 seconds. I think things, I think there will be, we will see some winners and losers as we move forward. OK. Maybe slightly less robust, but robust nonetheless. All right. Good stuff, as always.
