It's a special holiday edition. It is a holiday short and week. I'm Vanny Quinn, along with finale Basak. And we are just seconds away from those closing bells that you can hear ringing at the exchanges. And it's another update, at least for the Dow. But we just flipped negative finale for the other major indices, including the Nasdaq 100. Absolutely fascinating, Dave, because you did see that drop off in the 10-year year. But you did still see the S&P 500. Let lower the Dow Jones just in the green, the Nasdaq lower. Where you saw a little love was outside of those major indices. You saw the Russell 2000 with that lower yield story, up almost 1% about 9-10th of 1% body. So there was green in the screen somewhere in the market, just not at those major index schools. Yeah, there were people nibbling today, and maybe at the close, they were just taking profits, because they wouldn't have a long weekend before the beginning of a new year. But joining us now to break down today's market moves is Bloomberg's Alexandra Seminova and Natalia Keneyotyevich. So Alex, talk to us a little bit about some of the gainers that we saw, because we did see some very, very, very happy companies today. Yeah, Vani, even with the Nasdaq 100 down today, there is a technology sector that has been a big winner in this session. Quantum computing stocks broadly up across the board, a sector that has become an area of intense interest on Wall Street, and certainly one to watch in 2025. DeWave Quantum, more than 20% Regedi computing, more than 30% in quantum computing, more than 10% all these stocks have seen very pronounced moves here to date, up 1,000%, 2,000% on some of these names. And again, though, it's not on fundamentals here, but on the transformative potential of the technology, take QBT S, for example, a DeWave Quantum. This is a company with a $2.2 billion market cap and just $9 million in revenue. Another name speaking of tech that I'm looking at today is Apple. It's up about three tenths of a percent. This is after its price target was raised to a street high of $325 by WEDWISH securities, by none other, of course, than Din Ives. He says that the company is heading into a multi-year AI driven upgrade cycle. This upgrade cycle, he says, is being underestimated by Wall Street. He has an outperform rating on the stock, of course. And even though the move today was pretty modest on this upgrade, it is up more than 30% this year. And finally, I am taking a look also at GameStop, shares Rose as much as 10% today, up about 6% into the close. And this is, of course, after a post on X from Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty. You guys remember him from the GameStop saga back in 2021. This post was an image of a gift on Twitter without any techs. So no real reason that the stock is moving higher. And trading volume today was almost five times the 20-day average for this time of day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock also rose for a fifth straight session for its longest winning streak since November 1st. And GameStop shares are up about 86% this year, guys. Appreciate it so much, Natalia. Let's take a look at the, uh, the, uh, the decliner's on the day we bring in Natalia and now Savage for that. Right. So I'm looking at energy producers, guys, specifically companies that are related to natural gas industry. We see stocks like TARGA. It's one of the worst performance in the S&P 500. A QT is also lower. And the main reason for that is natural gas futures. We see that natural gas posted almost a 7% decline on Thursday. And that was driven by forecasts. Now, forecasters expect a little bit warmer than expected weather in the last couple days of 2024. As a result, it always builds concerns about some oversupply and futures of natural gas. Move lower as a result, we see that natural gas companies are moving lower as well. And another stock that I'm keeping an eye on is of course, micro strategy. We, uh, watch closely what's been happening with Bitcoin. It's now moving lower. Micro strategy shares are down by 4%, almost 5%, investors are also reacting to companies news to issue additional shares to fund further Bitcoin purchases. Just a reminder, micro strategy is seeking a permission to increase a number of authorized shares of class A common stock and preferred stock that's according to December 2023 filing. And of course, Bitcoin will be still volatile tomorrow as well because we see a huge option is expiration tomorrow. As a result, we will keep an eye on all crypto related stocks. Yes, it's going to be a lot of volatility between now and the end of the year. It looks like Natalia, also the VIX index itself, not showing too much fear today. The VIX was down to under 15. Of course, we know that that can move pretty quickly. So in general, we had a sort of a mixed day that about 200 stocks lower and nearly 300 stocks higher, but not hugely higher. But that's still pretty good, um, breath, right? Still pretty good breath, yes. And again, we are still looking at final trading days of this year. If we will see more potential upside move driven by the so-called Santa Claus rally. And now, as you mentioned, volatility is also on trader's radar. What I heard from sources I spoke with next year will be a little bit different. This year was volatile. We saw huge moves in the VIX index, but they say that next year volatility will be a little bit more predictable because they it will be driven by Donald Trump. Nothing projects, but something. It will be driven by Donald Trump's policies. And as soon as traders know what exactly he will implement, it will cause, of course, volatility. But you can play volatility in a little bit different way and potentially, again, more because they see here, for example, when we looked at those, uh, wall control funds, uh, those funds typically follow the market direction. They were lagging because it was so hard to predict volatility moves in 2024. So lots of expectations that next year will be a little bit different. Ladies, thank you so much for joining us today, of course. Uh, hard at work into the end of the year. We're all just kind of wiping off our calendars and playbooks to prepare. For 2025 and the end of the trade this year has certainly been strong. We're going to now be joined by Aaron Gibbs. She's Chief Investment Officer at Main Street Asset Management to talk about that playbook. So you think about the gains that we've seen this year. How much the S&P has been driven by those mega-cap tech names and a lot of people are scouring the market for other opportunities. How do you see those other opportunities playing out, especially when you see how sensitive some of the small cap names have been to the interest rate movements? Today, the Russell 2000 was your relative gainer. Exactly. I think now that we have a better sense of where the Fed is heading, we're seeing obviously more stable inflationary environment of slow and steady. And we're also looking at a reduction of fiscal stimulus where we're really going to see productivity are obviously potentially from AI gains, but where we might see company profitability would more likely be within some of your small caps as some of the larger caps are starting to face some headwinds. And from an investor standpoint, I'm not only looking at where companies might grow, where their profitability might come from, but also just where the value is. Because as we have had such big run-ups from these high expectations of increased productivity within these mega-caps, there really is a lot of money on the table from some of the smaller companies, some of the lesser-known companies, even within the S&P 500, where if they even if they just meet, let's say, 15% growth, they don't have to be 20%, 25% growth, but they're undervalued by 25% compared to historical gains. Those are the companies that could do really well if we finally see some expansion of market breath. You've really started to see markets largely shake off of many of the risks we've seen out there. That was interest rate risk. It was geopolitical risk. Yet we're sitting here at the S&P 500 at year-end well above 6,000 still. What are the risks you're looking at next year that could particularly throw investors off this more bullish course? So two with two big issues, I see one is just a slowing global economy. We're seeing some major economies really facing some headwinds, so China, South Korea, Europe. Those larger-cap companies, particularly multinational, where they do have to worry about revenue risk, they do have to worry about dollar currencies. Those are the companies that might face more headwinds than some of the more domestic-focused smaller companies. Another issue is just the reduction of fiscal stimulus. This really looks like from an economic standpoint, we're starting to hit that peak of the cycle and that the economy might slow down. So you need companies that are able to operate efficiently that aren't so focused on the fiscal stimulus and can really drive from other organic or new sources and more perhaps more domestically. So those are the two big headwinds for those are lack of slowing fiscal stimulus and then slowing global external trade that might really potentially do real some of the larger capital companies next year. Aaron, you say earnings may start to disappoint, does that happen already in Q1 of next year? After all, J.F. Morgan is out January 15th. There's only a couple of weeks away. Yes, well, we did have a rather low beat rate for Q3 already and we know that analysts started to lowering some of their expectations for Q4. Right now, earnings expectations for next year are pretty darn optimistic. We're looking at 14% growth for the S&P 520% growth for the S&P small-capped for earnings profit. Those are some high numbers. Whenever we're looking at mid-teens to even 20s, they have often been revised down. So we'll see, obviously, we have a lot to be able to deal with next year, even though at least the fed part of that story seems to be more stable. But certainly, I think people should be prepared for disappointment. And when the stock market really is high-prefection, as we're seeing in many of the sectors right now, particularly within the large caps, not within the small caps. Investors should be very wary if we do seem some weakening or some deterioration within the economy and within some of these industries. Where do you anticipate any weakening in the economy, Aaron? We haven't seen any really at all this year. No, we've been very fortunate. And I like I said a lot of it has been through fiscal stimulus through Dollar Trade. I think if some of the tariffs come through that Trump has promised, that could be a huge negative impact, particularly on materials, industrials, consumers, just a host of industries. And so that's something that I think investors should be very wary of and just remain up to date and be ready to switch if that changes because that type of policy could have a significant impact on companies probability. For next year, what do you think your favorite trades are to set up for the new dynamic under a new president? Yes. So one, I would like to say again, small caps, they're a little more insulated from tariffs. They might be again more domestically focused, less exposure to dollar and currency trades. So that's one of my favorites. And again, there's such a low value that just have less downside risk. On the other side, I do like some of the stable industrial sort of the growth at a reasonable price, it's names like Honeywell, Caterpillar, nice stable earnings quality. They can weather the storm, that can weather a few quarters of potential volatility and still breed expectations. All right, Aaron. Thank you so much for joining us on this holiday week.

Not everybody likes talking about money. Some people find it awkward. Sometimes they even find it a little embarrassing. I do not. I like talking about money. Whether it's the boardroom, the newsroom, the trading floor, I've spent the last 30 years talking about money, writing about money and talking about it and writing about it a little bit more. I'm Aaron Zetworth and every week senior reporter John Steppick and I answer your questions about personal finance and we discuss the best strategies for making the most of your money. Listen in to the kind of insights and explanations everyone can use to help them make better, saving and investment choices for themselves and their families. My question is whether you think maxing out my compy pension match is enough for when it comes to saving for my pension. Should I attempt to pay my child's university fees and living costs? My partner and I have access savings, so should we overpay on our mortgage or should we put the money into stocks? From Bloomberg podcasts, June Intermarin took money, for the Marintox money on Apple Podcasts, but by or wherever you listen. All right, let's move on now to another sticking point in Washington. One of President Biden's final acts in office will be deciding the fate of Nippon Steele's proposed acquisition of U.S. Steele. A government panel deadlocked on the deal earlier this week. Well this morning, Nippon Steele delayed the closing date of the deal into 2025, joining us from Washington DC now is John Harney. John, will Biden get this done and decided in the next 20-30 days? Does it have to be done or might it actually bleed into the next administration? Well, he has 15 days from Monday to say whether or not the deal should go forward. He has not said flatly he's going to kill it, but he has made plenty of indications that that will be his decision. The announcement today that the closing has been put off simply faces reality. They've Nippon Steele has put off the closing before this as this huge 12-plus billion acquisition has become further ensnared in American politics in the election. It remains unlikely at this point that Donald Trump will have a say on killing the deal or not, but both companies say that if President Biden says no, they will go to court and then who knows where it will end? To that end, what happens from here? Because this of course is a very politically sensitive deal, has a lot to do in terms of how steel workers in America feel about foreign ownership, and a lot to do with how the committee on foreign investment, CIFIUS, operates in relation to how they seek to block deals moving forward. What does it say about areas that are sensitive to the American economy as it comes to foreign investment? All those realms, if you will, are important. Certainly, CIFIUS, by the way, deadlocked over whether or not the acquisition should go forward, leaving it to the White House, and that was a step that had to be taken. But also, there's an international relation. Japan is not an adversary, like, say China, but a very close ally. Prime Minister Ishida Japan, today, urged President Biden to approve the deal. Now, well, they're not. He'll do that or not. We'll see what happens. But you're right in that this became a very political issue as many other parts of American business and culture have. Many steel workers have this, and other Americans have a strong history behind US steels, an iconic American company. But Japan steel and US steel say there are many good reasons for this acquisition to go forward, apart from politics, apart from, for lack of a better word in nostalgia. John, we have to leave it there. We thank you so much for joining us today. That is John Harnie of Bloomberg News. Jennifer Greigel. She's associate professor of communications in Syracuse University for more on Musk, Trump, and the future of social media under the new administration. So we're looking at what the president-elect might do moving forward. We're trying to read the tea leaves. How do you think social media is going to play a role in the upcoming world? I mean, how do you think they're going to really use Musk's platforms relative to some of the other more established ones you've seen out there? Yeah. Well, maybe a little context because I know over the last four years, I've kind of been sitting back a little bit more and watching this all play out. And I know Musk is the person of the moment and throwing around these sophisticated terms, retail investors. But it's really about the public sometimes. The market's trying to make sense of what's going on. And for me, the one piece that I've seen lacking in the media over the last four years, and especially last year is any critique of really the Biden administration and how they've handled not just like their leverage over social media, but even this upcoming potential TikTok fan that's looming and now it's going to the Supreme Court. And I know you're just talking about meme stocks and also Bitcoin like, you know, like it or not, President Trump is coming to power next year. And he has an incredible amount of leverage, ability to cut fields not just with TikTok, but any of those competitors. So, you know, again, sort of going back to Facebook, you know, it's no surprise that, you know, kind of late in the last election, you saw people like Mark Zuckerberg, you know, kind of maybe, you know, kind of posing up a little bit more. And I think it's because we were missing that context. I know for me, it was really difficult to cut through at times and to provide that critique, but I'm not sure the markets or the public have really heard enough critique going into this. It's been really focused on Musk. And obviously, he has the President's ear. You know, again, I know there's jokes about him being the unelected president. Of course, he's incredibly rich. And he has Twitter, but he has, again, he has made that work for him. So, for me, I think we just need a little bit more history and looking into, you know, those who were in power, they, I think they, they had a lot of confidence going into this that Biden would continue. And then they passed laws like that too. So I think it's going to be actually unsettling too. Some of those larger social media companies. I'm not sure. You know, again, their future is so sure. And then we should only be talking about TikTok, for example. Yeah, Jennifer, I mean, what would Donald Trump like to do? Because on the one hand, he needs leverage with a country like China, especially if he's going to be imposing extra tariffs and so on. And this seems sort of like a, you know, easy pickings, if you like. It's exactly. And he's got easy pickings with Bitcoin. Do you make a reserve or don't you? Right. So he, man, he has so many levers going into this next term. Right. So I think when we think about, you know, I think it's a note, looking at the last section. This is not a moment of clarity. Like we do not have confidence. We don't have certainty. And I think I think the markets are reacting to that more than just this bed, you know, announcement. Obviously we saw a major market moment there. But I see uncertainty coming into the end of the year. Not just because it's the end of the year. But because we really don't know how President Trump is going to play his cards. We just know that he has a lot in his hand. And Jennifer, all these tech executives that are visiting Mar-a-Lago and, you know, digging deep for their million dollars or whatever it's costing them. Well, in these US executives, I mean, in particular, what will that buy them? Yeah. Well, that was what was interesting about the TikTok case. Was that they went to extraordinary lengths to legislate the carve out TikTok. Otherwise, it would have looked just like every other platform, you know, Facebook would have been in the same situation. And that was kind of what I think gave TikTok comfort for a while. I think going into this legislative path was incredibly risky. It is a huge threat to freedom of information, freedom of expression. Unfortunately, you know, again, even the expiration date was right in front of the next term. It was, I believe, just an incredibly dangerous piece of legislation to target one platform like that. It doesn't matter if it was an external kind of foreign actor or whatever the reason was. It was very, very targeted. And the timing, you know, would have given the Biden administration some leverage not only with TikTok, but with maybe the sitting platforms going into the last election. Like that of maybe, you know, again, struck some type of sweetheart deal with Facebook. So it's really, you know, again, we have to look at the timing of all that. That was past and April last year, right? March, you know, we knew in March, Trump was taking the helm at the RNC. Again, I just, I don't like it. I don't like it. Professor, you know, you look at how TikTok has been treated by lawmakers and you've seen both parties really voice their concerns. At the end of the day, do you think that whether or not there is a full on ban that is pursued and the early days of Trump administration or a wholesale sale of the platform? Does that pressure really go away? Well, and great point again, I'm just trying to sneak into the tiny piece of critique on Biden here because we really haven't seen it. I mean, that's just that's been my experience in the last four years. And I haven't seen it much in the media. But as you point out, it was like bipartisan to get that through. But that again is is something that is telling. I think that on both sides of the aisle that President Trump was a threat, you know, and that it wasn't just Biden per se, but it was all of the incumbents. And we saw this actually way back in this reminds me honestly in 2012 when we saw under the Obama administration, they instituted the modernization of what was called the Smith Mont Act. And you know, again, Trump was starting to make waves at that time, started to maybe put his hat in their presidential rank. And the incumbents were bipartisan. And so again, it's a little bit of a gatekeeping action from those who are currently in Congress in the White House saying, hey, we don't want this outside or maybe coming in, you know. So it spoke to maybe the political climate of those who were sitting in power too that maybe maybe they were trying to gatekeep a little bit. But I just believe that it gave an incredible amount of leverage to any incumbent at that time. Jennifer, thank you so much. That is Jennifer a grigal.

From Bloomberg podcasts, June into Merren talks money, for the Merren talks money on Apple podcasts but a bite or wherever you listen. You asked retail sales this holiday season rose 3.8% compared to last year that's according to data from mastercard spending polls showing that consumers were more willing to spend in store and online if promotions were there and it's exactly the type of momentum that brands like True Classic are hoping to bang on. The men's wear brand is expanding its business across the United States. It's partnering with Target. Joining us now is the CEO of True Classic Ben Yahalom and you know funny and I were talking about this, men's wear. Where do people like to traditionally buy? It's interesting that you've partnered with Target more recently but are they going into the store? Are they going online to do it? I would say very soon to what Oliver shared that the ecomp penetration is being rising over the past few years but all in it's still very much the case that the majority of clothing is being purchased in a physical retail location, namely over 60%. How did you get to 500 million in revenue in just four and a half years? A new brand, nothing in its background to prove itself so how did it happen? It's a fascinating story. We pride ourselves on focusing on people and we want to make sure that they look at the best. Yeah but you know when everybody says that they all say it's always about the people and the people are special and our customers deserve the best but how do you actually prove that? What are you giving to the people that they were asking for and weren't getting? Great product, great service, great price point, great marketing. Product, we really nailed it with a perfectly fitted shirt that feels great, offered at a good price point. They love wearing it, they both with their dollars. From a marketing standpoint we do amazing ads that truly engage with our customers, tell them why they should care about us, how it's going to make them feel, feel a sense of confidence, feel a sense of self-esteem and they love that. And from a price standpoint we offer them a premium clothing option for a fraction of the price of alternatives out there and everybody loves a good value and we like delivering that consumer surplus. From a distribution standpoint we've done everything online on the main first first few years and now we're moving on to retail. So early days it's been very much direct to consumer and now we're on this path towards an omnichannel global brand. So who is your customer? What age do you see how much does he make and how tall is he? Okay, the variety of customers I would say the core one is a 34 to 54 years old man HHI over a hundred million dollars a year across the United States, majority in like California and Texas and New York but now we have expanded internationally so we have customers across different heights. We do have a decent number of customers in the United States over 27% or pretty tall, worth of six feet, two inches and only in its not just him but also her who buys for him and she buys for her dad, she buys for her husband, she buys for her son and she's a very important customer to us as well. When you look at your website right now the few things that are on at the top of the site, number one, most like staple six pack t-shirt, it was almost $180 for the pack but you can buy it now for under a hundred. Same for the classic three pack, it's marked down from 90 bucks for the three pack to less than 60 dollars. Are these really just holiday promotional drawdowns or are you finding a consumer that is quite concerning? Do you need to keep discounting into the new year? Yeah, those are our pack discounts. So if you were to buy those items individually, those would actually retail for $29.99 a shirt. But when you bind them in a pack, we benefit from stronger unit economics and we're happily providing those benefits over to the customer. So those are meant to incentivize consumers who are willing to buy and bulk to do so and therefore benefit from a steeper promotion and a steeper discount. How often are you finding people take advantage of those discounts right now? Because you mentioned pricing was one of your competitive advantages. Is it because you're able to benefit from those unit economics? Or are you finding that there's an optimal price for a t-shirt right now? I don't know if there's an optimal price for a t-shirt but I would say that the American consumer and I would say probably globally as well are tired of overpaying for premium goods and they are looking for options that don't compromise quality but offer that to them at a reasonable price point. And that's exactly the area we're playing. So talk to us about margins where you make most of your clothing specifically. I don't mean where you put the tag on. I mean where the actual product gets mostly made and how concerned are you for next year in tariffs? We have been already prepared for that for quite some time with the tension between the US and China and we used to be primarily sourcing our products from China but we've diversified our way and at this point we're pretty well diversified. We manufacture in Cambodia and Vietnam in Egypt and Turkey in Mexico and we have the ability to shift our supply chance to different vendors, different manufacturers worldwide to ensure that we are not in any particular pickle with tariffs, duties or even importation issues like we just had last week with a pretty big gift from the Mexican government who overnight just decided that we're not allowed to import more goods over there which is significantly impacting many e-commerce brands like ourselves but we have good options to mitigate against that. So Ben what is the secret because you've been also at meta and you've helped the hyper growth of other companies your four years of meta and you know you know how to leverage Facebook and Instagram marketing strategy and it seems that those are the strategies that work best these days you know consumers whether it's women or men seem to be getting targeted more on those platforms. Is that the success to true classic so far is that you've been able to do that and if so what advice would you give other brands? Yeah I would say that those platforms are definitely the main ones meta google etc to get a brand off the ground these days with relatively limited resources for us we were able to do strap this company to your point no x factors no celebrities no big VC money and grow it in north of nine figures in two short years and do so profitably on the back of digital advertising. So yes highly recommend for any brand who is trying to get off the ground to invest in really understanding how to leverage those platforms to their advantage but it's not magic it you have to have a great product you have to have a great service and you have to ultimately find that product market fit with that advertising model baked into your business model and when we did that and we are not just advertising the product we're telling great stories we're connecting with humans on an emotional level we explain to them what is the benefit of our products how they're going to fill in our product not just what is the product and that makes a huge difference so for us creative content storytelling excellent customer service exceptional quality in our products are all pillars of ultimately finding that product market fit and fast growth. So when you think about all of those social media platforms and by the way I'm a total sucker for buying on those platforms so I know what you mean but we all are how do you kind of kick through the noise because of course there are a lot of people selling on Instagram and on tiptocks so how do you get your story through without as you were talking about those celebrity names for example attaching to the brand. I think it all goes back to storytelling and if you really zoom out and look at that what gets you is someone who is able to hit the nail on the head whether it's a motivator or barrier to start a journey with a new company or by a particular product so for us it's always been for example like really illustrating very well the fit and the feel and how that shirt is going to look on you when you try it on and do so in an authentic way with influencers and customers who tell those stories better than we can and with that people actually pay attention and they want to give it a try and when they come to our site and they see over 200,000 five star reviews when they see that growing community of almost five million people worldwide and how much they're about it they want to try it especially when the price tag isn't particularly high so you have got to kind of figure out a way to to your point like stand out and differentiate yourself and I would say on the media side it's absolutely about storytelling and then from a product and offer standpoint that's where your website has to shine. How much does philanthropy matter because you donate T-shirts to homeless veterans, shelters, schools each month is that a big part of the story for you and what people are attaching to? Incredibly important but what I would say for us in particular is like we're actually not if you will like advertising and particularly forefront about that we do that because we want to empower people to look good and feel good and we generally want to do so not just with the clothing we sell but also in ways where we can deliver great clothing to people we need and most recently around the holidays we donated almost ten million dollars worth of retail value of inventory to many people around L.A. who needed those clothes for the holiday season. So I would say it's important for us as humans because we believe in showing up to humans and in giving back but I wouldn't say it's a core pillar of the story of the brand and how we've been showing up. I would say that still to this date probably many people amongst our customers don't even understand or know the extent to which our philanthropic efforts have gone and that's something we should probably do a better job articulating to them but I would say it's important to us as humans. Ben thank you so much for joining and all the very best your partnership with Target Expanding and that has beeniammer 2015!
