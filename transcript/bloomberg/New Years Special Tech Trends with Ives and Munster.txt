Capital Client Group Inc. Thank you so much for joining us for this special edition of Bloomberg Daybreak. Happy New Year, everybody. Welcome to 2025. Markets are closed for the holiday. I'm Nathan Hager. Coming up this hour, they are back. Let's become a bit of a tradition here. Two of the most prominent tech analysts on Wall Street are with us for the entire hour, getting you ready for what's hot in high tech in 2025. So without further introduction, we are pleased to welcome back. Jean Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, and Dan Ives, Global Head of Tech Research at Wedbush. Security. So great to have the both of you back with us on this holiday. And let's kick this off if we can with a look at artificial intelligence. Because obviously this has been the maybe the biggest theme on Wall Street since chat GPT came out two years ago. So Jean, here's what you told us this time last year about where you think we are in the AI cycle. Listen, we think we're in the early stages of a three to five year bull market. And I don't I wouldn't don't worry about the after. Don't worry about the hangover at this point. I think you just embrace that this is the substance we'll exceed the hype. And we've got some great years ahead of us from the market. You told us it's the third inning of the AI ball game, Jean. So where would you say we are now? I think we're probably on the fourth inning. We're still early, which seems out of touch with reality. But I think that that is how significant this transformation is going to be. And so we're definitely further along. And but I still believe talked about three to five years. I think we still got another two good years left here. And I think that as the you know this concept of the substance exceeding the hype. We are seeing that with some of the hardware companies, but we really haven't seen it beyond beyond a few companies. I'll just put this this is one of the the more encouraging data points is that opening AI doesn't break out these numbers. But you can back into them. They're daily active users for GPT global are around 150 million. 150 million. Google is daily active. Search users are 2.5 billion. In other words, even though we talk a lot about this, the the whole train really is still in the station. So it's still early innings for you. Let's turn to you, Dan, because here's what you told us about where you think the AI boom was this time last year. I mean, I think there's a two year bull cycle. I mean, at points when we get toward 334 AM, there will be issues for especially for ones that don't actually execute, but I see it. It's an auto bond. Is it still an auto bond for you, Dan? Or are we running into speed bumps? Well, it's 10 PM in this AI party that goes to 4 AM. And I think if you see how this is all played out as James talked about, this is just the first step in two trillion of AI catbacks. And I just would point to for every dollar spent on a video chip, we believe there's an 8 to 10 dollar multiplier across the rest of the tech. And that speaks to why we believe this is a bull market that continues to play out throughout 2025 and ultimately in 2026 because of where this spending is. And it just is starting. And that's why I always say the bears when they're in their caves in hybrid niche and mood like the last two years, they can find AI in the spreadsheets. But if it's still progressing, if we're still at the early innings for both of you guys, when do these companies need to show that they're getting past the early stages? I'll start with Eugene. I think with the software company, so we've obviously seen in the hard run, I love that 8x multiplier. I think that you're framing in there. And I think it just paints the picture of the scope of what's happening with hardware and also that this year, we're going to have to see some improvement in some of the software growth rates. And it doesn't need to be significant. We're talking about acceleration in the case of like Salesforce, they grew bookings last quarter at 10%. If they can inch that up to 12% for example, I think that that would be enough. All investors need to see in 2025 is just that the numbers are starting to move higher. They don't need to have these companies don't need to have breathtaking breakout like we've seen within video. We just need the tide to slowly rise. And I think that the trade is going to be intact. Is that how you see it, Dan? I mean, you were talking last year about an auto bond about this sort of breakneck speed at which AI could develop. Is a slowdown going to be enough to keep investors in this? Look, I think, I mean, to what James talked about, it's about software now is at the AI party. I mean, they were behind the velvet ropes, waiting to get their name on the list. And now we'll go there. It's the messy of AI pound here. You got sales fours, you got service now because the use cases are happening. And that's how pound here. Remember the heater, the heat is a teenager, 13 hours stock. Now the heat is a senior citizen in 80 because it's just starting to play out in terms of the second, third derivative that software that cyber security, that AI infrastructure and Christmas came early to the bowls with Khan out of the FTC. That means deal making finally is going to start up because that was a nightmare in Elm Street for tech, Khan, the FTC, that's over. And in Trump administration, it's a Goldilocks scenario for the bulls, especially the AI revolution here. And it's still in 1996, not in 1999 in terms of our view, how this all plays out. Talk to me a little bit, Gene, about how you see the regulatory environment playing out once we get into the early days of 2025. I want to add something to what Dan just talked about in terms of the 1996 analogy. And Dan and I were around there. We were covering tech at that point and lived that just really special time and investing. And I want to just mention, there's an important nuance to how the market I think plays out in 2025 is that during that run from 96 to 2000, during that period there were 10 pullbacks. There's 12 pullbacks from 95 to 2000. So 10 pullbacks. So about two per year is what we saw of 10% of greater on the NASDAQ. And I just want to anticipate joining Dan later on in 25 and talk about this pullback in the market like is this over. And I would just say this is it's really healthy for these multi-year runs to have these pullbacks. And so I'm anticipating as I said a couple of those. And what's going to be the piece that kind of what's the catalyst that does that it's always hard to predict. But we're going to get those and I still continue to believe we're going to end 25 much higher on the NASDAQ than we started. So I just quickly on the on the on the regulatory piece and I think that big tech has been you know largely in the penalty box when it comes to trying to acquire and innovate around that. And my my whole my expectation is that I think that that's going to loosen and they were going to see some some bigger acquisitions in 25. And I think it's going to be about bigger. They're small companies but they're going to have high valuations there on the private market today. And we can talk more about those but I think this is going to be a good year for big tech and that from that perspective. Yeah we are going to get into some of that. We are speaking with Gene Monster the managing partner at Deepwater asset management and Dan Ives global head of tech research at Wedbush securities. Dan to Gene's point about the possibility of pullbacks in big tech in 2025. I mean obviously we've seen the valuations where they are. They're sky high for a lot of people. You say they're justified. What is the risk that we could see a little bit of choppinus as we head into the next few years. Look and to that point when came out this year Tokyo Black Monday right I mean you had five or six other points. Some of the Fed and the bond into Annie's come out and those created the opportunities. And I think with Trump coming in there would definitely be some white knuckle moments with China tariff discussions. Game of high stakes poker going on right so there's me a lot of head on risk. But the Gene's point that's why you tune the noise out you focus in the winners and again the bear that's about valuation that's how they missed every transmission on tech team the last 20 years because when you're in the right lane going 35 miles an hour you're not focused on paying up for the Ferrari going 90 miles an hour in the left lane but that is AI revolution you will have those moments and you have your pencils ready. Just to play down. Let me add some to the head. Sure go ahead valuation because you're right on Dan another great point just about you know this the bears are are looking at valuation not recognizing the significance. Valuation of let's just go back and use the example of what happened from 95 to 2000 the the Nasdaq peaked at a hundred times earnings on on future right now we're what are we high 20s something like that we're not even close now given the dynamic of the mega caps today that we didn't have 25 years ago you're not going to get a hundred multiple on the Nasdaq but you might get a 50 multiple on it and so I think that this the conversation about valuation to me misses the point when a paradigm shift happens and euphoria kicks in really impressive things can happen on multiple expansion. I take frame with what what what genius said print that out frame it we're going to be talking about that in a year. Though I got to ask I mean it's the point that I guess gets brought up every year around this when you bring in the analogy of 1995 versus now it raises the question about whether this is going to be a repeat of the dot com boom I mean you both have talked about how artificial intelligence could potentially be a paradigm shift we've seen it play out in certain ways but other than chat GPT cute chat bots and you know changes in the way people search for things online how do we see that paradigm shift when do we get to the point that we're going to see the kind of productivity improvements across the economy that so many of the bulls around AI have been predicting I'll start with you Dan. Well the enterprise that's where it's happening consumers not even having for all these second half 25 going to down 26 but what's happening the enterprise that's what you're seeing the catback that's why gents and the godfather of AI that's what we're seeing across cloud you're going to see the paradigm change it's already happened with use case on the enterprise consumer that's coming still ahead it's each this multi year run in terms of what we're going to see in terms of fourth industrial revolution and your thoughts just quickly Jean I mean I think it's it's starting if you look at enterprise piece that's listen to many of comments from sales force about how he sees agents basically taking over half of the humans work it's it's in medicine we're doing experiments in projects and using AI and the investment side to and bottom line is massive cost saving so I think it's actually happening more it's just that the consumer piece is Dan said hasn't been kicked in yet and we're going to talk much more about this potential use cases for artificial intelligence and more of the hot tech trends coming into the new year as we continue on this special edition of Bloomberg daybreak focused on tech with Jean Munster managing partner a deep water asset management and Dan ives the global head of tech research and web bush securities with us for the full hour on this new year's day so stay with us it is 20 minutes past the hour on Nathan Hager and this is Bloomberg you get your podcasts capital client group ink welcome back to the special edition of Bloomberg daybreak i'm Nathan Hager markets are closed for the new years holiday but it's a high tech power hour we are speaking for the entire hour with Dan ives global head of tech research and web bush securities and Jean Munster at the managing partner at deep water asset management of course we've been focused for most of the start of this on the promise for artificial intelligence the continued potential for investment in this sector want to ask you guys where you see winners and losers now that we are at this stage in AI development so Dan i'll start with you who do you see as some of the biggest winners in AI heading into 25 look i think winners are software is going to be huge winner and that's pound here that's oracle at southforce.com MongoDB snowflake i mean the point is i think software is really going to be the beneficiary in 2025 is the use cases build out and i think more investors start to play second third derivatives of AI when you look at losers i think it's hardware i mean i think right now no don't try to do acquisitions like assist go review where assist go HP Dell i think a lot of the core infrastructure where their setup is just not a good place they're going to have to do mna but if this is trending much more to software driven and i'd even say hyperscarers they're just going to try to gain more and more market share especially with con you know they don't at the ftc what's your view on this gene who do you see as the winners and losers at this stage i think the sweet spot i would agree with Dan i think the sweet spot is going to come from software i think the the hardware piece is going to last a little bit longer but the companies that Dan highlighted is in a trouble direction i think that they're going to continue to be in a trouble basically if you don't have a real hardware AI play you're just you're just going to die in the vine and so i think that you know there's still more room with in video for example i think that some of the other micron big big sell off recently and i think that these companies are still going to be in a good place but the the substance of the trade i think is going to shift to software i think there's another piece that probably falls the fold for a lot we do private investing and couple companies data bricks is gaining a ton of share and you're going to hear a lot more about them they basically help organize unstructured data for AI training and then andro the defense tech company i mean if this was the last valuation was at 15 billion if this was a public company it would be a meme stock of all meme stocks it would i don't know what the valuation would be it would be exponentially higher and so i think there's some really exciting things going on with those two private companies are going to be part of our everyday conversation in the year or two in terms of the software plays dan how do you see AI playing out in terms of software in terms of use cases in 2025 look i think it's going to be about the install bases because as much as you know in video is going to clearly be a winner continued i think four trillion mark apple one with apple it's again 25 it's going to be about the install bases so when you look at from a doobie to oracle to service now to bany off i think the masterpiece where i see for for salesforce.com and of course names like pound here i think the use cases it's going to be agent force what we're seeing with salesforce but it's going to move to marketing to analytics to ERP we're going to see these use cases go from spot spot spot and i think that is going to be a huge part of the investing cycle as investors now focus on okay where skate to where the puck's going and i think that's going to create the opportunities is software this is going to be a golden age for software as well cyber security you know led by the fourth industrial revolution. Gene do you see some of these software cases playing out this year do you think that we'll see the kind of use case for artificial intelligence that you guys have been predicting over the last couple of years actually starting to come to fruition in 2025. Yes i think that in the back half of this year this the software piece we're going to start to see a slight increase in revenue these tools are starting to get rolled out and look at companies like service now they're already directly benefiting from this it's going to be this year in 25 it's probably going to come mostly from the mega caps and i think you know dance comment about bending off of i just emphasize listen to that his comments he spoke for 25 minutes 22 times he gave some statement about how transformative AI is going to be if you take that and divide it by five it's still going to be a i think this year is still setting up to be an acceleration in growth and so i think we will see the substance this year but i would just also caution people that some of the substance you're not going to see it's not going to be obvious it's going to be behind the scenes it's going to be in things like improving margins as companies start to implement these at the enterprise level and start to implement just more efficient agents and so i think that that's a different another piece that we're going to start to see in the back half of 25 is improving margins. Speaking with Gene Munster the managing partner at deep water asset management along with Dan ives the global head of tech research at wed bush securities with these kinds of changes guys there's the continued need i think for capital investment we've seen so much of that particularly in some of the biggest players whose market capitalizations have grown by such leaps and bounds not the least of which is Nvidia Dan how do you see capex playing out is it sustainable for this kind of growth. Look i think and it brings up a great point and i be interested to hear Gene's thoughts on this as always in terms of when you compare dot com to here because here the capex we're talking about two trillion of AI capex and what's amazing eye popping is sovereigns haven't even got into this yet you haven't even had the rest of fortune 500 global 2000 it's really really big tech today so when you look at this AI capex i can you follow the yellow brick road you follow the capex because if you follow the capex you're going to win on these stocks from semis to software to infrastructure and then ultimately to the consumer piece and and and to this point you have tech companies a 1.2 trillion of cash in the balance sheet generating three to 400 billion a year as opposed when you go to dot com and every time someone to do the scary Cisco Nvidia comparison on the chart those are funded by companies that were basically levered no business models and and it goes back to that dot com error i'm just trying to say a much different in apples to oranges comparison you follow the capex and i just wanted your gene stocks in this yeah that's the the yellow brick road down you got a great way of just illustrating things and i'm going to i'm going to plan that yellow brick road is that when this amount this level of a capex happens that's one of the reasons why i'm so confident that AI the substance is going to exceed the hype and this is going to be bigger than the internet is that the just the this degree is multiple times bigger than what we saw with the internet build out it will be 10 x 12 x 15 x bigger and when you have that kind of infrastructure in place there's just a natural gravity that the theme starts to pull in all these different applications and so i think that capex is probably the the most important factor to continue to gauge how well this is you know like is this going to play out at this point for those who believe that this is just going to be something more like mobile there's the level of investment i think is justification that this is going to have more substance to it but then you mentioned that sovereigns haven't really gotten in on this as much as some of the bigger companies have raises the question about what kind of impact trade wars could have on artificial intelligence if we get into a scenario where soon to be president donald trump starts putting tariffs on many of these sovereigns could that be a hindrance to AI development i'd be the bar extremely worse than the bite i mean the point is we give you look at how this is all going to play out i think you're going to ultimately have carve outs for the likes of test apple and allow the chips then a video makes and look this is all going to be a game of high stakes poker but when it all comes down to it i don't think it disrupts supply change dramatically and i don't think it disrupts the AI revolution because look china wants to benefit to the same extent that we that we're going to see here in the us but that's the i think when it comes to trump administration trump administration's bullish for a i the risk of these nations not investing in a i could be the end of these countries i mean ultimately countries that are going to need an a i first approach and so anything that happens with tariffs or any sort of economic slowdown that we may see across the globe is a small impact is a small factor relative to what needs to be invested and so this is top of mind spending it hasn't started as dan said there's another piece it hasn't started as well which is industrial AI the enterprise AI all this and this the concept that this is still largely big tech the stewardian i think that again is another piece that gives me so much confidence and sovereigns going to be there as well so gene right you say the yes sure if jimbar great point because me and jim of scene over the decades and decades cover an apple china tariff supply chain retaliatory tassel there was so many moments over the years where you could just give in a little cave and just basically hit the exit button on these stocks the point is it will create the opportunities when we sit here a year from now and i believe text up another 25 percent i think sovereigns become more involved and that tariffs becomes over some white knuckles but it doesn't ruin anything so jim how do you see sovereigns getting into this what's the catalyst for sovereigns to to get into the AI story i think you have to have a notoriously governments are slow to move and i think the catalyst is going to be when like the u.s and china are largely on board with that so i think there's a competitive piece that needs to kick in as a as a catalyst and i think that that probably starts sometime this year i think that they were going to see that's one of the reasons uh not just the the sovereign AI the catalyst is the competition uh but also with industrial AI i think that that's one of the reasons why i think that the envidity in video trade is going to continue to to be a good place to be so uh it's different than consumer and enterprise that's for sure when it comes to sovereign but there's a lot of money to be spent there and they have are just getting going and we're going to wrap up this hour long discussion on high tech trends as this special edition of bloomberg daybreak continues with gene monster managing partner of deep water asset management and dan ives the global head of tech research at wed bush security so stay with us it's 37 minutes past the hour i'm nathan hager and this is bloomberg you join capital group ceo might get one on the capital ideas podcast it's your look inside one of the world's most experienced active investment managers invest 30 minutes in an episode today subscribe wherever you get your podcasts capital client group ink thanks again for being with us on this special holiday edition of bloomberg daybreak always quiet in markets on this new year's day i'm nathan hager and it's time to wrap up this special high tech roundtable we have been spending the entire hour with gene monster managing partner and deep water asset management and dan ives the global head of tech research at wed bush securities it's been a great discussion on where things could go with artificial intelligence but as we close this out guys i want to focus in on some individual stocks some of the biggest names that you cover on wall street and i guess we'll start with one that fits the theme and video where do you see in video going gene i think it's going higher and i think that it is uh... like a surprisingly inexpensive stock when you think about off of the twenty twenty six numbers and uh... dan mentioned the white not going to well tell you what uh... a lot of investors and video investors are white knuckle over the boom and bust of hardware the business was about a twenty billion dollar business before the a i train got going and it's going to be about a hundred fifty billion dollars next year so uh... i've never seen anything like this at at this scale and because of that it just creates this concern that it can't go on and i want to stress too in video will have its day when the second derivative kicks in it slows down a little bit more than people think in the stack it's throttled i don't think that's this year i think this is the year where we start to reach out and video starts to reach out beyond some of the hyper scalers into some of these other markets that we're talking about and there another piece that is just getting kicked off what we're seeing around around this uh... it's time scale this infrancine time scaling that's going on these models starting to think more jensen talked a little bit about on their last call but that's a whole nother wave in terms of uh... the models uh... needing more compute capacity and so when you put all this together i think in videos uh... setting up to have uh... a good year a great year because uh... the expectations for calendar twenty six are going to move higher there have been so many expectations built into this stock you mentioned uh... some of the need to move beyond the hyper scalers into the sovereigns those are things that we've been talking about when it comes to in video for the last several quarters dan it can in video sort of live up to a lot of the expectation that's been built into this stock look we're just a recent easier trip demand the spot fifteen to one for indeed chips three months ago it was twelve to one it's excellent and that's why there's only one red phone if you need an a i-chip the guy father adjunct and then you i mean you can and the others that that may be called twelve eighteen months now will be there but that they continue to be the only game in town and i ultimately look you look out here could you get the six dollars earnings you're looking a hundred eight to two hundred hour stock and that's why i think this is one where any selloffs and in video their table founders you just don't i think you called for in video to be one of the first four trillion dollar market cap stocks is that right well guy the first one will be kupertino they'll cut the ribbon being the first four trillion and then that exclusive club they're going to welcome in jensen and video that four trillion dollar club and then followed by microsoft loading to apple with the reference to kupertino i know another stock that you watch very closely gene what are your predictions for apple heading into twenty twenty one i want i want dan to go first on this one i want to okay i i i'd say gene and i for decades why i respect him more than anyone on wall street it's seen the farce of the trees and apple's another one the a i revolution the consumer a i revolution comes through kupertino because it starts with iphone sixteen apple intelligence just rolling out but it's a multi year china's not even going to be rolled out till April so you start to look at this with three hundred million iphone to the window of an upgrade opportunity this will be the renaissance of growth for apple and that's why i think ultimately year from it we're looking for and a half trillion dollar mark cap you know as apple goes through what i believe we start to get three twenty five three hundred fifty dollars and i know gene is talked about this to up but this is the moment for cooking kupertino gene you know in terms of the numbers that back up that theme is that the iphone as the iphone goes so goes apple so goes the stock and iphone and twenty fiscal twenty four was flat fiscal twenty five the streets looking for three percent growth it was five percent at the end of september so analyst expectations actually come down and the reason they've come down is because the initial rollout of apple intelligence in the us has been in some eyes underwhelming and so the analyst bring their numbers down for fiscal twenty six is eight percent so it goes zero three eight percent they're going to beat those numbers and i think that i love to hand take on this mine is so for fiscal twenty five the streets at three percent i think we're probably going to be closer to five to eight percent for iphone growth and for fiscal twenty six that eight percent i think it's probably closer to ten to twelve which is like an order of magnitude outside of where i think most investors are thinking but ultimately i think that these features are going to drive an upgrade cycle and i just add the gene two hundred forty million units for iphone which will break you know break a record that's where i think they end up for fiscal twenty five and that's where the heater they heated two trillion despised it at three trillion at four trillion they'll be yelling from the tree tops so does apple get to look past vision pro some of the other products that have had to fall by the wayside things like the apple car is it all about the iphone can it continue to be gene definitely in fiscal twenty five it's about how i've owned telegens drive's iphone growth and like dan was talking about is there's also this pool from what happened in twenty one iphone was up thirty seven percent you get that effect starting to kick in that's just boggles my mind then investors just aren't tracking to that wave that's coming as much as dan is talked about it still like that light still i think largely hasn't gone on but they get because of that that opportunity they do get a pass on vision pro it's been a disappointment it is i think that the strategy it i think they just need to shift to doing more smart glasses ai glasses i think that that it seems that that's where the the market's going to evolve i don't i don't think we're going to see any products this year from that perspective but i do ultimately i think that that that is where apple goes so in the midst of not having a new product category it really is about a hard work category it's about the software the the ai product category in twenty twenty five we're speaking with gene monster managing director deep water asset management and wed bush securities global head of tech research dan ives let's shift gears to another stock dan that i know you watch very closely tesla it's been on a tear since the election of president like donald trump elan musk is very close to the president elect where does tesla go in twenty twenty five can it continue this break neck pays look there is a bet for the ages in terms of must bet on trump and i think it's your star because the autonomous future that's the goal of the end the rainbow for tesla deliveries to be out right now i think that's ten percent of story the autonomous and ai future i think it's worth a trillion dollars of loan to the tesla story in which i believe in a book case you can see a six hundred fifty dollar stock and you look now for cry to kid fans a sweet delay moment for regulatory nitson others and now autonomous starts to get i think a huge short of cat was which rump in there and has what is going to be the mean beneficiary i can argue tessa could be the best a i play out there you agree with that gene best a i play is tesla definitely like it's what that company is doing is more exciting than i think the rest of the mega caps all all put together when you look at whether it's autonomy whether they're changing how they produce vehicles what's going on with optimist all this puts it in that category so super exciting high valuation but really exciting and i think from from my perspective is that they're they're just slowly checking the box i don't know what the stock is going to do month to month on this i do feel it's going higher longer term because they are the most exciting company in ai and i think the just kind of put one other like further point of how they turn the screws down on these trends is we just had gm back out of their autonomous program effectively which is huge news and then separately what's going on with honda and nison it's really noteworthy and the car part of the business doesn't give as much attention but it's worth noting that that relationship is evidence that the car industry is going to get turned upside down in the next decade and they're going to be brands that we've known for a long time that aren't going to be around and my prediction is that this this mashup between nison and honda is going to essentially be a slow decline to the both companies will be a fraction of what they are even today and the reason for that is for what tesla is doing not just on the electrification side but autonomy and just those two companies just haven't innovated and if you're not innovating at just a lightning speed you're on your way to being a relevant in the time we have left guys let's talk about some of the stocks that we haven't talked about just yet that need to be on investors radar and i'll start with you dan well i think it starts with pound here i mean the messy of ai i think we're carbon pound here done that continues to sort of be the first piece of the software layer and i think this is really the model that more and more companies are going to go down the other thing is that the amount going to be spent in the belian ai is mind blown names like pound here are going to continue to benefit i believe pound here could be the next worker and that's why the haters will heat is a teenager stock the heat is a senior citizen continues to work topics gene what should be on investors radar i think google uh it's a company that is keeping up investors up at night because they don't know how perplexity or search for your gpt is going to be impacting their business longer term but uh search is just such a habitual behavior it's it's got to be ten x better i don't think these other players are ten x better yet and separately is that google has made a lot of progress i think that the company still needs a fire under them don't get me wrong i mean they've been asleep at the wheel here but just in the past year they made a lot of progress and the models that they showed at the end of uh december the new models that they came out with horrible name jimin i2 uh flash thinking i mean they they could have uh created a worse name for the product but it came it's out and available for developers and uh gpt is not there yet uh they just announced that it's coming uh just on the heels of google and that's a flip flop from a year ago now you see google ahead and i think that that's going to start to resonate with investors in in
