Time is ticking as the government works to avoid shutting down as Trump and Musk wield their political power. This as the big tech leader Mary Goround, Mar-a-Lago, continues with Bezos, the latest to try and influence Trump's policies and decisions. And to this season, for Intel deal-making, PE firms are competing for Intel's programmable chip arm, Altera. But let's just get to the broader markets in general.

The feedback is really compelling on accuracy, on ease of use, on the ability to draw together critical enterprise data and make some use of it. I think we're just on the cusp of that. We're going to see other companies do that. It makes for a compelling story and we can start to dream of a better time. We're a growth is better and part of that growth is going to come not just from the agents themselves but from the underlying infrastructure. We're seeing customers take on that hard work of improving their data, harmonizing it, getting it ready for use in investments in cloud and underlying infrastructure to make that work. We had data breaks CEO raising a lot of money in the private markets and they're all about being able to use the data underlying. To that end though, we're having a lot of the startups talking about a genty AI, trying to get in the space, taking on the still what's the giants such as Salesforce. Are we going to see more M&A activity once again? Everyone's wanting to bend off to hold off but more broadly these software companies are going to get back into M&A with perhaps a more friendly administration to it. Sure. Well yes, no and yes. I think we absolutely do. I think part of the reason why we've seen that rise in software evaluations since the summer is because of this friendlier stance. We're likely to see at least on large companies buying smaller companies. We'll leave the rest of large company administration aside. But there's that. We will see a lot of startups trying to get in the space and some will be successful. There's always disruption when there's a new cycle, a new tech wave. But what is compelling is that we can see these large companies capitalized, augment their portfolios. We're seeing them do that. Salesforce specifically, they are making tuck-in acquisitions. Ultimately, we probably see them do something about right now. They seem so focused on what they have at hand. That we may not see what we've seen traditionally from the company in terms of Laura Gemini. And in fact, the company still has a large swath of activists on the board who are highly engaged. And keeping a close eye on the purse strings. Very more broadly, therefore, when 2023-2024 was so dominated by one name and Nvidia and everyone asking you about the infrastructure to the software names that you've really kept an eye on, are we going to see this shift now? Is everyone going to just be more around agents? Is it going to be the time of quantum? What do you think 2025 is going to be the cocktail party question for you? Okay, that's an exciting one and one that will change every week. We have cocktails. We're far more. We've had this push and pull between semis and software the entire time. As investors, try to identify the real AI beneficiary. In reality, over time, they'll both be strong beneficiaries in one way or another. The names within that group may shift. But I think software is starting its period of appreciation of AI. In agents, as I mentioned, I think they represent the period of shift from homegrown AI or do it yourself AI to do it for me AI. And the customers would, for, prefer the vendors do it for them. It's going to be better, faster, cheaper in the end. And so I think that's a story that continues. And there are other things I like about software. Semis are in the process of getting beaten up. There's a lot of debate over whether we're going to see the big behemoth, million GPU, pre-trained models or the smaller models, or post-test time training, where the training occurs at the point of inference. And that will have financial implications. But in the end, we're going to need a lot of semis for what we're about to do. The Devon, so way, eclipse is supply. Hello, we're fresh. It's my pleasure to have you in the studio, senior research analyst at Clearbridge, but always leave wanting to talk a little bit more. Meanwhile, Intel, let's talk about a chip company on our mind. It's been shortlisting a number of buyout firms for the next round of bidding for Altera. That's its unit, which specializes in the design of low-powered programmable chips. So look on intersources. Let's bring in Bimberg's Ryan Gold. So how close to the end mark are we here? How many serious bids have come in and how broad are they? Yes, if you think back Caroline to just before Thanksgiving, we put out a story that said that they were calling for bids. I think just prefacing all of this. Altera is kind of the single biggest topic in tech M&A right now for people who specialize in semiconductors. It's taking up a lot of time. People are spending a lot of money thinking about how to sort of structure their bids. So bids came in. Just not to Thanksgiving. And so Intel has now got into a period where they have shortlisted. You've got firms like Bain, who know Intel very well. You've got firms like Silwale, who also know Intel very well. And then there are others such as Apollo, who are also looking for Francisco Partners, who are quite experienced semiconductor operators. And then just to add a little bit of intrigue to the mix, lattice semiconductor, which does specialize in what we call FPGA's, the same type of technology that Intel is trying to sell here in Altera. They are also in the mix and also in the second round. But their own market capitalization, not that huge, so they have to partner. What are some of the options here? Does Intel internally want to fully hand over reins here or keep skin in the game? I think Intel is quite coy on what it really wants to do. I think if you look at what they've said publicly, they have stated that their plan, even pre and post-PAT, is to sell a stake and eventually take Altera public. But I think just when you're in the situation that Intel's in, there are options. And you know, options on the table have to be considered. You have to think about the long-term future and sustainability of those options. And so I think if something is presented to them that they see as compelling, they will give good credence to it. And I would just say there are many sort of proposals on the table here. There are multiple parts, outline, different suitors, for example. There could be a situation that you see a group of private equity sponsors come together and take this on and sort of use their operational mouse to kind of transform or tear into what they think it should be. Well, a few bankers are going to be busy over the festive period. Rangled, we know that you will be too. Thanks so much for coming on. Meanwhile, coming up time is taking for the government to avoid a shutdown. So, it's Trump and Musk way in. We're talking how busy politicians are at this particular moment. Just take a quick look at one particular stock on the move as well. I just asked Hillary, look, is 2025 going to be the year we talk about quantum? Well, it's here it's now and it's up 21% for this particular stock. One name where Craig Hallem is maintaining a buy on this particular company raising the price target to 45. We've also had yesterday, D.A. Davidson, also initiating coverage with a buy rating. We're piling in. This is Bloomberg Technology. The House of Representatives could vote on a temporary measure to fund the government for a brief period, a never to shut down. That's according to two news networks. Fox News, NBC, citing sources. This after the House led by Republicans rejected a temporary funding plan despite Trump and Elon Musk's pressure on GOP lawmakers to support it. Bloomberg's Kaley lines joins us for now from Washington. It feels as though everyone's intent on not having a break before the holidays. Yeah, usually the holiday period and the smell of jet fumes is enough to motivate lawmakers to get done when they need to get done by the deadline Caroline. It's very close to the wire here, keeping in mind that government funding does expire at midnight tonight. So we're talking a window here of just under 13 hours. And it's not yet clear what exactly plan C will be after plan A failed in part because Elon Musk and Donald Trump wanted to see that initial 1547 page bill die then the plan B a much slim down bill that also extended the debt ceiling for two years failed in miserable fashion on the House floor last night with 38 Republicans voting against it. So I think the question is going to be can something get through the House today that will avoid a shutdown. We are expecting that Republicans will be holding a conference meeting just over an hour from now at 12.30 p.m. Eastern time where they could be informed of what the plan is next. And there have been reporting has been reporting from punch bull news that they could actually end up just dividing the bill that failed last night. So essentially holding separate votes on a continuing resolution on the debt ceiling measure on disaster relief and seeing what can get across the floor. Because there's two tug of war here for those who aren't as in the weeds as you are on the one front it seems as though this is pushed largely by Musk and Trump that we don't want to see this pork this money being given away in terms of federal aid. But on the other side is the Republicans that are really flinching to the idea of the debt ceiling just being put aside for a couple of years which doesn't seem particularly fiscally responsible according to that. Yeah that's exactly right Caroline. This is a relatively new idea that has at least publicly been introduced by Donald Trump in the last several days this notion that the debt ceiling either should be extended or repealed lifted entirely permanently before he takes office on January 20th. Now lawmakers have spoken with including the Democratic majority with Durbin last night suggested to me that this is likely because he knows he wants to get through a tax reform package next year and lifting the debt ceiling is an easy way to get that done or at least make that process easier. That said there are a number of conservatives in the house many representing that part of that 38 that voted against this measure last night that do not want to see the debt ceiling raised because they want to see more fiscal responsibility than that. So that's really going to be the question is we move forward today. Can something that lifts the debt ceiling get across the floor is it really only it's something that's going to keep the government funded for some period of time it could ultimately be shorter than what they were initially planning which was a three month continuing resolution that would kick the can down the road to March 14th. But Speaker Johnson has a very difficult needle to thread here because he has to abide by not only what his conference wants and is willing to vote for but what Donald Trump and Elon Musk clearly are willing to see across the floor and he has to stand for Speaker election again on January 3rd when the 119th Congress sits and there's a very open question at this hours to whether or not given everything that's gone down in the last several days Speaker Johnson is going to be able to keep the gavel. Katie Lines, great break down. Thank you. Now we continue to report of course on the tech titans who have been meeting dining with President Electrum in the last few days of course you know that Metacio Mark Zuckerberg seemed to kick off the rounds of meetings. Google co-founder Serge Brin on the action, Amazon's Jeff Bezos the latest. This doesn't even include the other big tech leaders who are officially working within the incoming administration. You know Musk is the co-leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, David Sacks, the AI cryptos are Mark Andreessen as an adviser we understand just to name a few. And the most cut Wagner joins us to discuss the new intersection of tech and politics going into 2025. Some names that we already know very much about but I'm sure a few more trying to line up for a dinner invitation. Yeah I mean everyone seems to be making their way to Mar-a-Lago. There is a very different feel this time around Carolina as you might recall from 2016 at that point. You know Trump did hold that sort of famous meeting in Trump tower role. The tech executives ended up coming but it felt more like they were almost forced to be there right. And they were dealing with their employees back at headquarters, most in Silicon Valley complaining and protesting and all this stuff. This time it feels different. They're going sort of one by one. They're having dinner at Mar-a-Lago. They're you know being very friendly and I think the awkward situation here is the Elon Musk of this all right. Because all of these people are competitors in some way or another to Elon or his companies. And often when they're showing up to dinner in some cases like Jeff Bezos from Amazon, Elon Musk is at the table right. And how much can you really say to Donald Trump how much can you really accomplish when one of your biggest enemies is sitting right there across the table from you. Certainly space competition fears between Blue Origin and SpaceX Kurt. But ultimately what do you think that they will achieve by giving small in the case of the absolute balance sheets they have. And more amounts towards the inauguration of Trump and indeed these meetings where they're showing off. I think Mark was showing off the the meta glasses and the latest innovations to President Electrum going forward. How is this sort of dovetailing into actually what they want to see from a legislative agenda. Yeah, I think everyone sort of is in agreement that the best way to stay on Donald Trump's good side is to you know, pray some to show up and and sort of demonstrate that with a public display of affection. Right, whether that be a million dollar donation to the inaugural fund showing up to dinner and making that track across the country to be there in person. And every one of these companies wants something different, but I think generally if you want to blanket state it, they don't want him to come in hard with regulation around all the technology they're building, especially with regards to AI right like the last thing. Mark Zuckerberg wants, for example, is for the Trump administration to suddenly say, hey, we're going to try to hamper this AI growth. We're going to make it very difficult for you, Mark Zuckerberg in particular because you didn't show up tomorrow, logo and make Trump feel special, right? And so I think they are all doing what they need to do just to simply be in his good graces and hopes that those relationships because they are so important to the incoming president, those relationships will ultimately help you know make their road easier over these next four years. Many feel akin to Peter Till now, who's the only one really in 2016, how times have changed, Kurt Wagner. It's great to have your time. Thank you. Time now for talking tech. First up, Tencent and some related stocks, as you'll see, soaring on Friday after investor enthusiasm is taking over on a new gifting function on WeChat. Now the feature will allow users to give gifts, price less than $1,300, excluding jewelry and educational services, according to a statement, snacks, cosmetics, service providers, all likely beneficiaries. Plus, sticking with Tencent, it's partnering with Honor on Cloud and AI development. As as one of China's top device makers, Honor is among Tencent's higher profile cloud customers. It'll use Tencent's big data analytics and search tools along with two companies jointly creating a coding assistant to help Honor software engineers. And by do extends its decline, as investors react to news that Apple is in talks to work with Tencent and bite dance on, you guessed it, artificial intelligence. It also comes as newspaper reports that bite dance has slashed the price of its new AI model. And hon-high precision industry, the Taiwan-based manufacturer of iPhones, of course it's known as Foxconn 2, is putting its interest in pursuing Nissan on hold. It's one negotiations for potential merger with Honduras underway. It's all according to source, meanwhile, Carlos Gone, who was the architect of the Renault Nissan Alliance 25 years ago, said that the tie up between Nissan and Honda is a quote, desperate move. Here's what he told Bloomberg yesterday. The cash problem, they have investment problems. They're being really hammered in the United States. They got practically out of Europe. They're being challenged in China and there is no plan in front of it. So I can tell you that there is panic mode inside Nissan. In fact, that was Col. Gone speaking earlier today with our own Manus Krani. Let's get out to Craig Jarrell for the latest on the tie up. And indeed, all of it was catalyzed Craig by Foxconn's interest in Nissan and Japan, racing to ensure that Taiwanese companies weren't buying up Japanese ones. But now it's out the game. Yeah, I think we can't necessarily rule out at this point that Foxconn will completely leave the picture here. I think this is a case of real genuine interest. You have an executive at Foxconn who's overseeing their EV initiatives, who is actually a former Nissan executive, which sort of adds to the intrigue. You also have a case of just a very complex deal. And it's very unclear at this juncture what exactly is going to happen between Honda and Nissan, if anything. You do have a case of Nissan really needing some help and effectively needing a rescue by all accounts. Likely, some role that the Japanese government is playing here and trying to kind of nudge these two companies together. But real questions about how exactly this is going to work out. And also another company in France and Renault, who also is going to come into play. So watch this space in 2025. I think there's no respect for you when it comes to deal coverage, Craig. Very briefly, China, the weak spot for both. Yeah, absolutely. I think both of these companies have been shrinking in that market. I think there are questions about their long term future there, as well as a lot of Western companies. You know, what exactly is there going to be in terms of room for international companies given the desire from China to really dominate this industry and also dominate its own market? Craig, you're down. We thank you, as always. Welcome back to the Mectanology, I'm Caroline Heider, New York. We check in on one key reflection of risk sentiment over the course of this week. Bitcoin, at one point on Tuesday exceeding $108,000 per token. And now we dive down to about $97,000 level. We're only up about 5% since the trading days on Sunday. Remember no rest for the wicked. This trades 24, 7. But we are seeing just mummily come out for the first time. In fact, after 15 straight days of money going into those spot Bitcoin ETFs, we had a pause and a record outflow on Thursday, $6,080 million. People start to digest what higher for longer, just two rate cuts come 2025, really does mean for an ultimately record run that we've seen for Bitcoin since the election of Trump. We want to dig into what some of the experts have been saying, our investment management CEO, for example, Kathy Wood joining Bloomberg the close yesterday to discuss her outlook for Bitcoin in 2025. She also talked about her bets on Tesla and how much the incoming Trump administration will impact the Tesla story and in particular, autonomous driving to take a listen. Well, I think one of the changes again back to regulation is the likelihood that autonomous mobility, so robot taxis, are going to be regulated not on the state level, so 50 different regulators. But on the federal level, after all, autonomous vehicles will travel from state to state, so it really should be federal legislation. So I think that will speed up the move towards autonomous taxing networks. And I do believe for that reason, investors and analysts are starting to model out what that will mean to the Tesla model. It will take their gross margins from mid teens right now up into the 60s if we are right, because robot taxis and autonomous taxi network is a SaaS model. I think the other thing that has happened is more and more people are seeing videos of the humanoid robot doing all sorts of things that we didn't think were possible as the dexterity in its hands gets so much better. I do want to pivot here and ask you about some of the market action, particularly over the last few months, and particularly when it comes to crypto. I'm sure you've seen the big run up in Bitcoin above briefly above 100 grand now back below that today, but certainly phenomenal run on a year to date basis from where it was just a few months ago here. Do you still sort of see Bitcoin really hitting some of those lofty milestones that you've talked about before? I mean, 100,000 is still a long way from a million. I do kind of wonder how much further you think this could actually go. What was interesting about Bitcoin today, now that we're going to get more regulatory green lights, we're seeing institutional investors focus on this new asset class. And as they're learning about it, they're saying, wait a minute, this new asset class or this component of a new asset class Bitcoin is going to reach 21 million units out there, 21 million Bitcoin out there at its peak and no more from there on. Where are we now? We're already above 19 and a half million units. And so if institutional investors are looking at this new asset class more seriously, and Bitcoin is really the first of its kind in a new asset class, and we'll be, we believe, the biggest opportunity of them all. They must consider an allocation. And so supply demand, they're doing the arithmetic, and we see a million to a million and a half by 2030 that the probability of that has increased because of institutional. Some fundamentals there from Kathy Wood of our investment management, let's stick on Bitcoin, the crypto ecosystem a little bit more. As we've seen, of course, it falling from its record highs and having impact on some of the smaller coins too. All following the hawkish signals coming from the Fed, Matt Havonson the House, Bitwise asset management chief investment officer Matt. Just we saw the fundamental reasons why Kathy Wood is still bullish into 2025 and beyond, but should anyone be worrying about the sudden weakness that we've seen in the last few trading days? No, it's great to be on. I think the weakness we've seen over the last few days is a healthy pullback. If you look at the crypto market big picture, it's run up substantially since the election. We saw a lot of leverage build up in the system. And this is a natural washing out of leverage. There's been about $2 billion of forced liquidations over the last two days. This has happened in crypto since it's very grueliest period. We need to reset the leverage levels and then we'll build from there. But the long term drivers are still intact. We're still in a strong bull market. I think Kathy is right about where this is going. We feel exactly the same at Bitwise. I mean, you're someone who has seen some highs and lows. You understand the volatility and the asset class, Matt. But I'm interested in who is coming to your asset management company. We've got some exciting music playing on set. They're that thrilled to hear about what you think in terms of institutional money coming now. Bitwise, is it still a flood of retail and high net worth individuals? What are you seeing in terms of changes? Yeah, it's really been both so far this year, but I'm aligned with Kathy in thinking that the institutions have now started moving in in size. When you saw the 15 straight days of inflows into the Bitcoin ETFs post election, I believe that was institutional capital. At Bitwise, every year we survey professional investors and ask them what's keeping them out of the market. And for six straight years, they said a lack of regulatory clarity. Well, that regulatory clarity is coming and that's open the floodgates to institutions. And I would just say, I think most people underestimate the size of this. BlackRock just came out and said most people should have one to two percent allocation to Bitcoin. There's a hundred trillion dollars of institutional assets out there. Two percent is a lot of investment that still has to happen. We're going to start seeing that really come in in 2025 into Bitcoin still predominantly. How is this going to broaden out Matt? Yeah, you're already seeing it broaden out actually. A lot of people were worried about the Ethereum ETFs, for instance, which launched this summer and had tepid inflows. But over the last month or so, you've seen billions of dollars flow into those products. Again, the things that have happened in crypto in the past keep happening historically. Most people enter crypto through Bitcoin and then they discover Ethereum and then they think about Salana. There's no reason to assume that the institutions that came into Bitcoin won't move on to other assets in the future. In fact, I think in 2025, you're going to see an explosion of interest in index-based strategies. They give diversified exposure to crypto. Of course, something we've been doing at Bitwise since 2017, when we pioneered that concept, I think 2025 is when that sort of becomes a mainstream way to allocate to this phase. The same way it is to stocks and bonds and real estate and everything else. You were talking about how the regulatory picture is going to become clearer. We've seen a new AI crypto ZAR announced. It's someone who's invested in Bitwise, David Sachs. How much have you been in touch with David? How much have you been ultimately able to steer the conversation from a Bitwise perspective? David is a good friend of Bitwise, has been an investor for a long period of time. The reason it's so important to have someone like David Sachs in that position is these two industries are critical to America's future. They've really been constrained and challenged by regulatory overreach, regulation by enforcement. I think the market probably doesn't understand how fast these industries can move if there is regulatory clarity. Bitwise is involved in Washington. We talked to folks in Washington all the time. It's great to have people who understand crypto now taking office. I'm just excited to see what happens from here. You went back to something you just said that things happen again and again when it comes to crypto. The dominance of Bitcoin was your pursuit of thought. But what happens again and again is that all boats rise and all boats are great. We see meme coins coming out, thick and fast being spun up. There's fun and there's exuberance and there's an air of being at the scene of the table at Blackjack sometimes. I'm not taking that away from the market participants but how much is there a worry that meme coins are going to become something that do ultimately hurt those who don't understand them enough, the trading nature of it all? Yeah, I think that's worth being concerned about. And again, I think the answer there is better regulatory clarity. We've sort of taken a hands-off approach. We're not going to touch this, which isn't the right way to help investors. We need reasonable rules that allow crypto to thrive but separates the good from the bad. So it's absolutely true. Investors moving into crypto should be careful. There's a big difference between Bitcoin and the latest AI-driven meme coin. Folks need to understand that. So yeah, we worry about this. People need to understand why memes coins exist. I agree it's an exciting part of the market but it shouldn't be a huge part of your portfolio. Let's just talk about the intersection of Triedfire as people would call it and crypto. And how we're seeing a fusing together. Real world assets is something people talk a lot about ultimately going on to the blockchain of some sort. But Matt, there's also new offerings being spun up, whether it's in the options market, whether it's just other ways institutionally minded players can access the overall ecosystem. Is that progressing and ensuring the way you want to see it? Yeah, absolutely. We've been talking about crypto as a new asset class for a number of years and a new asset class needs all of those pieces to thrive. It needs options. It needs ETFs. It needs ETF options. It needs futures. It needs other derivatives. It needs institutional players taking part in this ecosystem. We've been checking every box as an industry. So people who are skeptical that this is going to be a major new asset class that stands alongside stocks and bonds and commodities in real estate. You just need to look at that track record. So from my perspective, it's been beautiful to see we've made a hugely forward in 2024. And I think that's going to accelerate in 2025. Now, how can a bitwise asset management say, well, happy holidays? Thank you. Coming up, we'll discuss AI agents and how they're revolutionizing customer service. Catherine Costa Rera is with us from Creation. This is Bloomberg Technology. The EU has given unconditional approval to Nvidia to buy the Israeli startup Ron AI, which developed software for handling AI computing resources and has been a close collaborator with Nvidia since 2020. The European Commission stated the takeover didn't pose any competition threats, despite Nvidia's position as a quote leading producer of key hardware for AI applications used in the EU and beyond. Now, let's just take a little bit look about the applications of AI, in Gen to AI. It's all going to hear in 2025. Let's bring in an expert therefore. Catherine Costa Rera, CEO and founder of the No Code and Software Automation Company, CREATION, valued at more than $1.2 billion. You've been raising funds last time we spoke. And you're taking on some of the heavyweights that are publicly traded, Salesforce Service Now. And I'm interested as to how the agent force of Salesforce is something that you've already been doing at CREATION or having to play catch upon. Hello, Caroline. So first of all, thank you very much for having me. Very excited to be here today and very excited to talk about the future of enterprise software. I can tell you that I've never been as excited about the industry as I am now, even even when the internet was developing, even at that time, I wasn't as excited as I am today because the CRM and workflow automation software, No Code platforms that creation, creation is building is going to look completely different in street to five years from now. Very excited times. Okay, so it looks different because already you've been helping basically people who can't code code, but now agents isn't the co pilot model just makes things even more bespoke. Have you not been deploying that already in previous situations is now the market's caught on to it. Yeah, really. So creation has been AI native and the biggest difference of creation from you mentioned Salesforce, for example, is that we combine in AI command center, all different patterns of AI. It's obvious a generative AI like AI skills is agentic AI. It would be predictive AI. It would be prescriptive AI. So dependent on the use case again, you mentioned service. It could be sales automation, marketing automation. We're going to be doing the particular use cases combine in all different patterns of AI. And as it is a native, it's not an additional module on top of it. It's not like we announced creation as a separate additional module and we charge for it. It's actually quite an opposite. We're not charging for it. It's the creation platform because AI is the central part of the platform. Ultimately, with everyone offering some sort of form of agent and a lot of it helping with coding, how do you fend your territory, even if you're saying you're not having to pay extra for the generative AI or new AI applications is in your heart, but once others have got their pricing sorted and they're already in the rooms of your customers, how do you fend the territory? Yeah, brilliant. So first of all, let's talk with the saying that what creation AI delivers is two parts of the equation, if you will, from one end, it's no code development as you exactly correctly said. So with AI building the applications on our local platform and the second part is using AI in the end user use cases like moxon automation sales automation service automation in name. So the combination of those two, these are the biggest power that creates your delivers. And again, being AI native, it's not a separate module on top of the existing platform. It is the platform itself. So the experience of the user is completely different. The experience that we're building with the user is creating for the user is not the user learning how to use the software. It's AI creation AI is learning how to collaborate with this particular end user of the application because as we all know, English is the future program and language and basically the collaboration between the user like yourself or myself with the workflow and CRM software in the future, it's going to be using the natural language using the natural language. And the natural language I will be asking to create close to create new digital campaigns and it's very simple, very simple interface that is embedded in all the other applications that you are using as well. I'm really interested in adoption and ultimately that seems to be a bit of a bottleneck. We're hearing of late that there's seen a plateauing of employees using the tools that have been invested in by the CEOs and the like because they were that they're being deemed lazy in some way or not. We're not only the training that's necessary, but we also know that really to see real creativity, you just need to get this into users hands and see how they adopted. What have you seen at Creatio? How have people been using it and continuing to? Yes, and listen, thank you very much for asking this question. There are two aspects of it. So the first aspect is everyone is building and developing the new AI skills and Creatio does exactly the same where expanding the library of AI skills, meaning we expand the number of use cases. That can be covered using AI. And again, the future, if you ask me about 2025, the future is that the user can do any CRM use case in Creatio AI without actually opening any other interfaces, just one Creatio AI interface and collaboration in English. So building those AI skills, it takes a little bit of time, but Creatio is definitely in front runner here. But from the other side, let's talk about this, the price and portament because in the case of Creatio AI is literally the platform itself. So all our users who have the base licenses of Creatio, they already have access to Creatio AI while in other cases with our competitors, they do need to acquire to buy additional licenses in order to start this adoption process. So partially, I guess again, I don't know exactly the sales force numbers, but I would guess that would be partially the reason why their adoption is not as fast as they would expect to predict. And just to clarify, it's not Salesforce's numbers. It was actually some numbers put out though by Slack, though we were looking across various different industry groups, across various different AI adoptions and different tools. But it was great to speak with you. Thank you for coming on. Happy holidays. Catherine, Christopher, Founding for CEO of Creatio. Teams does union members. They're striking against Amazon for a second day, just as shoppers make their final Christmas purchases. Groups of workers at seven facilities in California, New York, Illinois, Georgia are demanding better wages and working conditions. Amazon says it's filed unfair labor practices charges against the union as the team says claims a strike expansion is coming. Blue MoxMat Day has been across this story and how much impact is it's actually having? Best we can tell, not a whole lot. These are seven facilities and that sounds like a lot, but against Amazon space of something like a thousand depots in the US. There's a lot of wiggle room they've got to send packages through other facilities, especially as the teams are making noise about a potential strike for more than a week now. So they had some events noticed this was coming and they knew which facilities. So I wouldn't expect this to derail their operation at all. But what about derailing the future path of unionization more broadly? Matt, because all of this is about teams just trying to lure over more people to join I see. That's right. On that front, I think we'll see, but this is definitely the biggest action to date targeting Amazon by US labor in the United States. You know, there's been union drives at specific warehouses before, known as EverTried. What the teams are doing, which is organizing across their delivery depots and contract workers and Amazon blue badge employees themselves. So this is a pretty big effort. Amazon for their part says it's a lot of PR so far, but you know, they certainly have the teamsters full attention now and they're taking a seriously. Look, other companies being affected by strike action at the moment as well, Starbucks being one of them. And I'm interested as to how these leaders of the businesses are looking towards the next administration, because many workers feel represented, but many feel that perhaps some things said by Trump and Musk around unions have been pretty adverse to them. Yes, I think union folks are pretty sober on the reality of the change administration right the national labor relations board has been a very labor friendly body under the Biden administration. That's likely to change in the Trump years, but that said workers have said listen, this is all about developing support on the factory floor, you know among your barista pals among people packing packages, right? And that's not necessarily been a change. It's all about what kind of support they can drum up among the workers rather than does DC have their back. That day we thank you, Amazon shares, still training higher amid some of the strike action. We really appreciate you joining on it. Now let's just get back to the markets a little bit more broadly now because it's a volatile day folks and unsurprisingly so because it's triple witching. What does that mean? Options expiring it just as that level of volatility as we come towards the close of the week. We're up 1.6% now in the last act 100. We were negative territory to start trade people trying to brush off some of the perhaps over movement over reaction to the Fed signaling there'll be about two cuts coming in 2025 crypto those still under water 96,000 well off the 108,000 level but boy what a run it has been for 2024. Now that does it for this edition of Bloomberg technology do not forget to check out our podcast. We're going to be joining on the terminal as well as online on Apple Spotify and I heart. We'll be back in the new year. You'll see me across other other programs. This is Bloomberg technology. Not everybody likes talking about money. Some people find it awkward. Sometimes even find it a little embarrassing. I do not. I like talking about money. Whether it's the boardroom, the newsroom, the trading floor.
