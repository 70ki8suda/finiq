Inside from the reporters and editors that bring you America's most trusted business magazine. Plus, global business, finance and tech news. The Bloomberg Business Week podcast with Carol Masser and Tim Stenevek on Bloomberg Radio. No question the idea of safety on a lot of minds after the events over the last few days. Absolutely. Okay, we heard from law enforcement folks in Las Vegas a little earlier today. They talked about what happened in Las Vegas. We heard earlier in the day too about what happened in New Orleans. The event in New Orleans, that one specifically being called terrorism. FBI officials say they haven't found evidence linking separate deadly New Year's attacks in New Orleans. And Las Vegas. Those are still unfolding though the details there. The two incidents though, Carol rattling Americans as they rang in New Year's prompting heightened concerns over US security less than three weeks before Donald Trump is set to take over as president. And then there was this beta plane crash last month. The Azerbaijan Airlines flight that crashed in Kazakhstan on Christmas Day. And then you also had the flight that crashed in South Korea killing all but two on board. There's a lot of things going on that make us question safety security in today's environment. It's something Sean Gallo is always thinking about. He's CEO at ProAct Safety. It's a consulting firm that for more than 30 years has provided strategies for improving safety within different organizations including organizations such as Boeing. He joins us from Houston, Texas. Sean, good to have you with us. Give us an idea of how you think about events over the last week because what I just shared were certainly they really run the gamut of things that affect a person's safety and individual safety. But they're also rare but they're top of mind because they're in the news. How do you think about events such as these? These are Carol Tim. Thank you for having me on here. These are some of these black swan events that you rarely see coming. However, they're often indicators and what I've often said is anytime you're surprised by a significant event or a tragedy. Either you weren't paying attention to the indicators or you weren't giving them the attention that was necessary. It's unfortunate that events like this have to have to necessitate a change. And there's a lot of great people that work for Boeing. I know many of them personally. And if you go back over a decade, 2005 and several years later, you look at what happened with the BP events, the Texas City explosion March of O five that 15 people lost their lives and over 100 seriously injured. Then we had deep water horizon, the Macon incident, both of those moments before days before. Both of those locations, the rig and the plant BP leadership was there to give them an award for their safety performance and then both of those tragedies occurred. It's the same situation kind of here in my opinion with what's happening with Boeing is that they're a great organization, a legacy organization. Again, in my opinion with a lot of wonderful people with great intent. They also from what I've seen went from an organization that I would have referred to having strong signals to an organization that had weak signals. It was an organization run by engineers. Engineering was often on the floor. People could talk about things and unfortunately over time it seemed some of that became suppressed. Shill, take a step back for us because we are intrigued by your relationship or your workings, your company's workings with Boeing in particular. Tell us how long you've been involved with the company. Tell us about kind of maybe the changes that you've seen and your involvement in helping them get through what has felt like crisis after crisis after crisis. Although things seem to be getting better, but it does feel like there's still a lot of questions to be answered. Yeah, I can't speak to the detailed specifics of the type of work that I do with organizations like Boeing. My work focuses on the pursuit of excellence and safety. So that's both performance and that's that's culture. So organizations like Boeing will bring people like me and from time to time to make sure they're not breathing their own exhaust to make sure they're truly seeing things as they are. So they like an objective third party individual, take a look at things. They also bring in people like me to keynote it at some of their events. What does that mean to keynote it? What does that mean when you come into Boeing and a company that's dealing with some really serious issues? What does it mean to keynote it? So this was in 2017. So it was prior to prior to the catastrophic events that happened in 2018, 2019 with the with the plane crashes. Keynoting a private event. So company leadership was there together to look at their long term safety strategy, look at their their business strategy. And at the time I had just authored a book called forecasting tomorrow, kind of looking at making predictions over the next 10 years. So they brought me into service a keynote speaker to that. And that's what led to me having the privilege of walking the 737 max factory floor in the end of February 2017. And so for me personally, it's always stuck with me. Did I see one of those two planes in the assembly process? Obviously, I'll never know. But it's it's something that's always resonated with me because most of my work is on the proactive side. That's the name of our company. However, we are brought in from time to time on either side of litigation, but primarily on brought in from the company standpoint to make sure events like this are they want to. So before so before anything goes wrong, right to say, Hey guys, here's what you need to be thinking about. That's exactly right. And sometimes this is done through attorney privilege document so we can be fully transparent and tell them, you know, these are the issues. This is because culture is a byproduct. And now the FAA and now all of these third party investigations are identifying these cultural deficits, some things that aren't where they want them to be as an organization. But every company of substance, substance size is going to have opportunities to improve culture. But cultures of byproduct. You can't directly manage the byproduct of culture just like the results of an organization or byproduct sometimes of collective intention. Now sometimes luck. So you know, I do wonder, you know, Boeing went through a lot of changes corporate culture. We talked about the changing of headquarters and senior management, then not being, you know, very far from, you know, their main plant out on the west coast and so on and so forth. But I am wondering when you key noted the address or anything, did you start to see some changes? Did you give the company any kind of heads up like wait a minute, you guys might want to rethink some of your strategy here. I think they had a good plan at the time. I didn't have insight into the potential business instructors of that plan because the safety strategy can't be a standalone concept or plan for an organization. The safety strategy has to support the overall business trajectory, but it also has to protect against internal and external risks that might affect that plan. So my work was primarily on the safety strategy side of things, the business strategy and organizations like Boeing, they typically are forecasting several decades out because they're looking at the next platform. They're looking at, you know, what's going to be coming, you know, 20 years from now. I saw some, I saw a lot of great leaders with wonderful plans to execute on, but I think the erosion of trust and the erosion of communication and speaking up about quality or safety concerns. What seems in my opinion to have been unintentionally, but suppressed over time is what led to one of the big contributing factors of kind of what's happening today that as you mentioned, distancing senior leadership who are ultimately responsible for any organizational culture, even though they're not really part of the culture is too far removed. They're responsible for it, and when I look at the plan that they have today, that's one thing that I would offer some advice on is that if you look at what they're focusing on, it's primarily around changing employee behavior versus what are the leadership truly being held accountable. We only have about 30 seconds left, but I hope in talking about the incidents new years, even New Year's Day, New Orleans and Las Vegas respectively. How would you advise large municipalities, just in 30 seconds to keep people safe during events that are happening? Events such as these are during New Year's stuff like that. I think it's largely around having the showing the force, but it's also situational awareness when I served in the military keeping your head on the swivel, you have to pay attention what's happening around you at all times. You also have to have contingency plans, and if you look at this recent crash running into a wall, unfortunately, that wasn't part of the contingency thinking. So I think you have to have a proactive side of things, but you also have to have emergency response and a reactive because things will not go to plan. And if and when things don't, what's the next step? What happens afterwards? It's not all about prevention. It's also about recovery. All right, going to leave it on that note. Sean, thank you so much. Appreciate it. Sean Galloway, you see your pro act safety joining us from Houston, Texas. Not everybody likes talking about money. Some people find it awkward. Sometimes they even find it a little embarrassing. I do not. I like talking about money. Whether it's the boardroom, the newsroom, the trading floor. I've spent the last 30 years talking about money, writing about money and talking about it and writing about it a little bit more. I'm Erin Somsetworth, and every week senior reporter John Steppick and I answer your questions about personal finance, and we discuss the best strategies for making the most of your money. Listen in to the kind of insights and explanations everyone can use to help them make better saving and investment choices for themselves and their families. My question is whether you think maxing out my company pension match is enough for when it comes to saving for my pension. Should I attempt to pay my child's university fees and living costs? My partner and I have access savings, so should we overpay on our mortgage or should we put the money into stocks? From Bloomberg podcasts, June and Tim Merrin took money, for the Merrin Tox Money on Apple Podcasts, or the Vi or Wherever You Listen. You're listening to the Bloomberg Business Week podcast. Catch us live weekday afternoons from 2-5 Eastern. Listen on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business app or watch us live on YouTube. Carol, get this. We did a deep dive into the USDA's economic statistics. I was just thinking about Mike McKee the whole time because I know he knows all this stuff. All right, what did that deep dive? Food purchase and consumed outside the home. So I think restaurants, fast casual bars, hospital schools, delis. Yes, they have this information. It's a category accounted for close to 60% of food expenditures in the US in 2023. Food away from home. It's a lot of money, right? That's a lot, yeah. Food away from home, spending climbed from 1.3 trillion in 2022 to 1.5 trillion in 2023. This is according to the USDA's economic research surface. I didn't know that even existed. I didn't even know. It's pretty cool. Makes sense though. Phil Kaffirakis watches this number closely. He's the president and CEO over at IFMA, the Food Away from Home Association. It's a trade group for the food service industry. He joins us from Washington, DC. Phil, how are you? Going great, Tim. Thanks for having me. Hey, good to have you on our program this afternoon. Food away from home. I did cider sort of deep dive into this because I had never looked closely into this category. But it really is exactly what it sounds like. Anything that you buy outside the house to consume outside the house. So bars, hospitals, pre-made food, it delis, everything, right? Yes. It's a term that's been used by the government to report. And we as an industry just started using it as we transformed our 70-year-old organization from being the manufacturer driven to the Food Away from Home, which includes everything you just mentioned, from food manufacturers to the distribution companies, the restaurants, independent restaurant chain restaurants, casual dining, hospitals, key asks, even now delivery is a component of all of this. That's what I wanted to ask. Yeah, so it includes like Uber Eats Door Dash, if I call the local Thai food place, and they deliver on their own, it includes that as well. Yeah, delivery, you know, coming out of the pandemic, everybody was so caught up with how we were going to transform the business and the resiliency of the restaurant industry just keeps surprising people. But delivery has become an incredible part of what's taken place and facilitated food away from home. This is a question that when I was talking to Carol about this during prep, this is a question that she had when I told her this number. She said, is this all about prices going up or is it people actually eating more outside the home? Like transactions? Yeah, what's happening here? Yeah, yeah, of course. Of course, she was the... It's both traffic has been a very stable, I would call it. In some instances, depending on the segment, it's been down. However, because prices have gone up and because of the promotional activity, you are getting more meals, higher check averages, and depending on the segment, you'll get more traffic. I'll give you an example, great organization in Darden and the way they run their business. They have multiple brands, you know Olive Garden, and they have all the state houses. So when you look at what they do at Olive Garden with the... The never ending pasta that get people back into their restaurants at $13.99, that's a pretty good price point. So they're getting traffic, they're getting a higher check average because they're adding $4.99 if you put some shrimp or protein on that meal occasion. So the restaurant industry has been able to do some things to keep traffic up and also drive their check averages. However, you know, there is a downside to all this, and I'm sure we'll talk about pricing and inflation. Well, on the one that drives my husband crazy, and I'm like, let's get this, and then I'm like, what's this? And then this, and then this, and then like a simple salad also, and it's like $40. No, and then I'm like, I'm not going to get this delivered, I'm going to go pick it up myself and save 25%. And because the delivery fee to tip, like... We do that all the time, increasingly, not all the time, but increasingly if we can. Alright, so what's the downside? Well, the other side of this is we've got the inflation monsters roaring at the beginning of the year. Commodity prices are soaring. I mean, just when you think about coffee and chocolate alone and cacao and coffee beans, but you know, protein, if you go try to get a steak, an eight ounce, you know, filet somewhere, depending on back to the garden, if you go to Ruth Chris, you're going to pay eight ounces, you're probably going to get it for close to like 50, 60 bucks. If you're going to go to Longhorn, you can get a Texas T-bone for $21.22. So depending again on what you're looking for, what you're going to get, the concepts and the restaurant tourists have been able to price accordingly. The problem though is we've got costs in the supply chain. We've got not only commodity costs, but we also have organizational issues with not only the labor coming back, but labor is an issue when you think about just in fast food in California starting at for one this year, $40 minimum for being behind the counter at a McDonald's or a Burger King or so. Not only is it just availability of talent, but it also costs some money to be able to get the right people in the restaurant and make sure that the services where you want it to be and they're trained and you don't have any problems. Hey, I want to jump in real quick. $20 minimum wage for fast food workers in California with the hindsight of a few months after that has been implemented. How has that worked out in your view? And how does the industry, your members, like are they happy about it? Yeah, no, no one's happy about it. Maybe the people who are working are happy. Right. The people that are working are happy about it. It's not about that. I mean, we want to make sure workers are getting paid fairly. And you know, there's a balance here so that employment doesn't go down and people don't close restaurants because somehow because of the labor problem. But you've got a situation in California where there's a panel of industry experts apparently that are going to determine what the rates are going to be. And it's a little bit awkward. Everybody's been trying to find a way to manage it properly to keep the staff feeling good about what's going on. But at the same time, is a regulatory issue that is going to cause havoc and confusion as it goes across the states because there's also a tax credit, a tip credit problem coming down the road. So when you start the fact of that out and then you see what's happened with organized labor, people are paying attention to restaurant staff and and servers and a back of the house and everybody you need to be, you know, part of a happy, go lucky team that provides a great experience. And we know certainly coming off the pandemic, what a tough industry it is, the restaurant industry overall. Even some of the really established names, the well-known chefs and their organizations. I mean, it was not an easy environment to say the least. Having said that, I mean, what is top of mind for the members of your organization as they look at 2025? Is it food costs? Is it labor costs? Is it the administration? Is it regulatory oversight? Is it concerns about the economy, the US economy and consumers pulling back? What is it? Oh my God, Carol, you name it all. I mean, part of what we talk about here is WUCA, the WUCA environment. When things are, you know, there's volatility on certainty, complexity and ambiguity coming together. Well, that was happening when we came out of COVID. But now you've got, you know, attention deficit disorder meets WUCA. Right now, you have to be focused on what's going on in your restaurant, meaning that you've got to be careful with what's happening with your costs, your menu costs. You've got to be careful with what you've got on your menu. You've got to have happy people restaurant in your restaurant, creating a service environment that people love. You've got to be on top of your promotional activity to balance that out. You've got to be a good partner with your supply chain and the distribution community that's serving you and the manufacturers that are trying to get your product. You cannot be caught up in all this anticipatory, you know, distractions around tariffs and the immigration policy and some of these things that have been chatted about. Everybody's a little bit worried about what might happen, but you know, right now, I think everybody's focused really on beyond the regulatory environment. And we have things in regulatory that are taking place already that we've got to worry about, but it's those factors that again make up your PNL and make sure that the industry is not going to get caught up in some whipsaw because somebody's expecting that there might be tariffs or they might not be tariffs. There are things for us, particularly regulatory right now that are taking place that are important to focus on. That will pass restaurant tours and the supply chain and our members money. Hey, one of the things, Tim and I spend a lot of time talking about is the global food supply chain and the impact climate change has had on all of it. I am curious to that what you are hearing from members on that front, how it is getting more difficult in terms of accessing the necessary food supplies that they need and then how that potentially plays into inflationary pressures sticking around longer. Yeah, that's a thank you for asking that question. One of the things that's going on right now, you're hearing a lot about it and I've worked some of your experts talk about a cocoa and coffee. I mean, the weather effects across the world are the adverse weather conditions that are taking place, particularly in the South, in South America right now. The things that are happening that drop in Brazil, the situation out in the ivory coast, again, not only crazy weather patterns, but also a disease in the crop. When you're starting to look at those type of effects in the supply chain with raw materials that we import, that does drive prices to all time highs, especially when you think about cocoa. And it also causes problems because if you can't recover very quickly in some of these instances, there's a thing called swollen swollen shoot disease that goes into the vines and to reply a cocoa something might take five years. So there's an effect with that and then of course the effect being halfway around the world is the supply chain cost of moving product, you know, from one end of it to the other and that continues to be a point of concern when you're thinking about long term and you're thinking about short term, particularly when you're trying to give coffee for less than five bucks. We only have 30 seconds left bird flu. How concerned are your customers? How concerned are your members about bird flu? Yes, it's come up. Everybody's a little freaked out about it because we did have it before the holidays. Folks are managing it. It's very localized and at this point in time, it doesn't, it hasn't created any major issues right now in the supply chain. All right. It's watching it. Okay, Phil. We're going to have to leave it there. Hopefully that's the extent of what happens when it comes to bird flu. Phil Kaffirakis. He is president CEO over at IFMA the food away from home association a trade group for the food services industry. Not everybody likes talking about money. Some people find it awkward.

Listen live each weekday starting at 2pm Eastern. On Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business app. You can also listen live on Amazon Alexa from our flagship New York station. Just say Alexa play Bloomberg 1130. Okay, we know about the greatest generation. Check. The silent generation. Check. Do you know there's a generation before the greatest generation? What is it? They are called... Are you serious? Yeah, the lost generation. Oh, I do know that. Yeah. I do know that. I do know that before that. Right. And then there's the... That's neither human. Sorry, everybody. And then there's the massive boomers. Boomers. Gen X. Gen X. Millennials. Yep. Gen Z. Yep. Then where else? Then it gets a little complicated. Yeah. Gen Alpha. That's 2013 to mid-2020s. Okay. Those are my kids, I guess. Okay. And then now that we're in the mid-2020s, it's time for the next generation. Duh, duh, duh. We're talking generation beta. Okay. And they're born from 2025 to 2039. So most of them aren't even alive yet. All right. So we're waiting. We're waiting. We're rejecting what they're doing. What they're going to be like. Happy birthday to them. Despite that, PGM set out to figure out what this generation would look like. They interviewed doctors, scientists, parents, and more. 2000 Americans to get predictions for the future of generation beta. David Blanchett is managing director portfolio manager and head of retirement research at PGM. He joins us from Lexington, Kentucky. David, happy new year. Great to have you here with Tim and myself. So tell us about this project. Because we really haven't talked about this next generation generation beta. So tell us what you set out to do. Well, you know, first, you all kind of introduced this idea of generations. And you mentioned baby boomers. They were actually the first generation to kind of have a name. There was a group of individuals at a certain age. And right. So we've kind of moved forward to the time you mentioned the boomers, generics, millennials, you know, the alphas. Now we have the beta. So everyone born on January 1st, 2025. So the next 15 years is going to be part of generation alpha. And obviously, there's still a lot of those babies to come. But you know, we were curious, like what might the future whole? Like what are we looking at in terms of this newest generation? So as you all mentioned, a pretty exhaustive survey. You know, reviewing kind of expert opinions, surveying 2000 Americans. Lots of interesting perspectives that people have about, you know, things like life in general, retirement, longevity, just lots of interesting projections about the future. I mean, don't you think if you went back in time, I'm just trying to figure out a coral area here that makes sense. But if you went back in time, you know, to the, to the 1970s and said to folks, what do you think people born, you know, in the 1980s to the 2000s? Would experience in life? Like they're not going to be talking about smartphones and, you know, AI. They're going to be talking about flying cars because that's what we thought would happen. Right. So there's this disconnect between predictions and what actually happens, right? Well, I think that that's why, like this is, I think this is informative. It's useful, but it's really difficult to think about what's going to happen in the future. Right. So, you know, for example, you know, one of the questions in the survey was like, what would you call this generation? And you just said it a second ago, but like the most common nickname was generation AI. Like even, even three or four years ago, that probably isn't the name that we'd use to describe this later, this latest cohort. So I do think there is a lot of things that are changing, but to me, like this idea of change was probably the biggest theme in the survey. Well, this is lots of expectations where, you know, kind of every facet of raising children, of saving for retirement, of lending for health care, people will change in the future, especially for this generation beta. What about in terms of, I'm really curious about how we work, right? Here we are, four years off the pandemic. We thought it was going to be transformational. And I guess for some who are still working from home, it is, but there's a lot more people who are being pressured to come back to the office. How do you think about this generation, or what did you hear about how they think they will be working? Sure. So 83% of respondents thought that retirement will look completely different for generation beta. And, and well, why is that? Because there's idea of, of many retirements and this idea that as we kind of evolve through the workforce, we're going to be changing, changing jobs. So, you know, other stats would be that 74% of people thought that generation beta would work less than five days a week. And 80% of respondents thought that people would have three distinct career paths over time. So I think that there is this kind of emerging perspective, that this idea of having kind of one job and one profession for, you know, 30 or 40 years isn't the future of work based upon how things are changing. David, is that because we're going to be living to 150? So yeah, we're going to have these many retirements. We're going to have these many, you know, transformations in our careers. And people will be living longer. You know, so I, I focus on retirement research. And I don't think we're going to have most people living to 150, but we are going to see improvements in longevity. Right. And those improvements kind of radically create complexity around me on how we plan for retirement. And so to me, it isn't all that surprising that there's this perspective that, you know, generation beta isn't going to retire. And to the extent that we can, we can, you know, create jobs and create abilities to work longer. Lots of folks that want to retire. Actually, I personally, I don't love the word retirement, I think the word financial independence. What we want to be able to do is just to save money and eventually stop working. And I think that's where we're seeing this perspective around generation beta where they're going to be this in theory, this group of individuals that doesn't have the same retirement as everyone else. And I said, you know, a set that blows my mind is that they're not going to be, you know, 870 until the year 2095. So retirement in in 70 years is going to be very different than it is today. Oh, to be young born in 2039. Sure would be nice. Already ready. I'm thinking about it. One thing that I was surprised and you're reminding me about this is in a history class in college, I remember studying, I believe it was in like the 1920s, maybe the rise of leisure. And the fact that people had, they weren't stuck in the fields, you know, 12 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year for the first time ever. So there, there are certain things started happening. And I could be getting the dates wrong and I know I'm over generalizing here, but I think if they were to look at our lives now, they'd say, oh wow, those people never work. But when are we going to have like a four day work week or three day work week because automation is going to be doing such a good job. Are you asking for them or for you? I'm asking for me, one of the markets can only be open four days a week and then we only have to work four days a week. That's what I want to know. So, you know, 74% of respondents in the survey thought that generation beta would work less than five days a week. So I think that again, there is this idea of of work becoming more fluid versus this kind of structured nine to five thing. Obviously we saw, you know, during COVID, a rise of remote work, people not to be in the office do their jobs. And a lot of companies going to pull people back into the office. I think that I think there is this emerging perspective that this requirement to be, you know, in a desk in an office five days a week. It's not gone, but it's kind of slowly evolving into something else that is a lot more flexible. One thing I want to talk about is healthcare. We talked about longevity. And I feel like there's a bunch of things here in terms of your findings. I'm just going to be leaving that cancer will be cured by Gen Beta 71% predicting that Gen Beta will have individualized healthcare based on their DNA. And I feel like we continually are increasingly Tim are having conversations about individualized medicine. Talk to us a little bit about more about that because it's an incredible cost to society. It's an incredible cost to individuals that we still haven't figured out some of these major elements. So pull that together for us. Yeah, I mean, I think that that's kind of an optimistic perspective. You know, I too saw the 51% stat thinking that Gen Beta would cure cancer. I think that I think that to me, what resonates looking across the responses is this idea again of kind of like the evolving state of healthcare. I think the idea of personalized medicine, you know, there's some questions about like AI things like that. I think that I think the way that individuals can receive, you know, treatment is going to change. And I think that that was a key theme among the respondents in the survey. So healthcare, I think that people think is going to evolve in the future and radically affect generation made in terms of how they enjoy their lives and also when they eventually retire. Okay. Get better, better get to work. I was kind of hoping cancer would be cured before that fingers crossed. I would love to see that. The other thing is just one more stat on all of this 59% think AI artificial intelligence will be able to predict and prevent health issues before symptoms appear. And I, you know, it's just as you know, we have spent your investment world. And I think the last two years talking about nothing but AI, generative AI, large language models and so on in the impact, although I think people are thinking it's going to take a while for all of this to pay off and be put to work. Yeah, I mean, I think one of the questions was like, sick person respondents think that AI is going to raise their kids. And so I think that there's a lot of a lot of a lot of positive expectations in here around artificial intelligence and how, you know, it's roll in terms of education. In terms of the role of kind of helping individuals have better personalized experiences based upon their unique preferences. I'm wondering about technology because and the folks you interviewed. How did their, how did their answers vary based on how you talked to because you talked to doctors, you talked to parents, you talked to technologists, you talked to scientists. How did they think differently about different generations? Well, you know, it's funny. You know, one of the differences that I noticed with the responses was like the like the older generations like boomers weren't, weren't as optimistic about like the, the possibilities, the future of the generation beta. You know, beyond that, you know, if you look at just like maybe at a higher level, if you look at things like like like regrets and and the things that that people would change based upon their lifestyles, you know, you have things like like saving for retirement and spending time with kids and like that, like, you know, those, those were very different for older American versus younger American. So a lot of the questions I didn't see big differences in in terms of, you know, looking at like boomers, millennials, Gen X, but you do see it in terms of things people say, well, like what I wish I had done differently looking back on my life. Yeah, I mean, it happens all the time, right, whatever generation it's called, right, like I think there's a lot of social media posts that go viral about that now. Yeah. You know, people who interview people at the end of their lives about what they regret, what they want to do more of. And it's never. It's never, let me just say it's never tweeting more. That's what I'll tell you. I never say I wish I would have spent more time tweeting. That was a safe play. Yeah. That was a safe play. Hey, having said that I was kind of drawn to a statistics that you shared with our producer and our team, the people surveyed, estimate that generation beta will need approximately $1.88 million to sustain in retirement. That seems like a low number. It's well, I think it's all it's all relative. It's it's a big number. But like I said, I mean, we're talking about people retiring, you know, 70, 65 years from now. I think that I think there are some really important things here. Like there was one, I think, useful stat that like 80% you know, think that generation beta should like in a perfect world start saving for retirement as soon as the child. And that's probably not realistic. I think most, you know, I have I have four alphas myself. No betas. Yeah, no betas. No betas. No, I think I think I think I'm no plan beta is on our half. But I think there is this notion of your wife is calling. Like retirement's tough. Right. And so I think that one thing that will make retirement tough is we talked about earlier is this increasing longevity. But I also don't love that word like I said retirement. I think that I think that it's going to be more possible for us to do things that are economically additive at later ages. Right. And I mean, along those lines, like, you know, one of the important stats in the report was the number one regret of all respondents was they didn't save enough for retirement. Okay. What's really interesting is is that is never the highest regret of any of the generation. So like not saving for retirement is this kind of regret that kind of echoes across generations. There's never the biggest thing like if you look at like like boomers for example, they wanted to, you know, spend more time with their loved ones and take care of their health and things like that. So I think that I think that you know, we like there is that big number that 1.88 million. But I think what's important is is that is is you know, things like not saving for retirement, you know, was actually a bigger focus among among younger respondents. But they're worried about like everything like like they have just have like for redress galore as individuals get older. Those regrets fade away, but to your question and point retirement is is very expensive. Right. We start living to age 110 120. It's even more expensive than today. But is it also something that's more top of mind maybe for younger generation because it's not like when my dad retired and there was pension and VA benefits and social security and investments. I mean, there was all these different pools and it's a very different environment for a lot of workers nowadays. What is I mean, so we've got I think you know, like personally, I don't love the fact that the trust fund for Social Security is projected to go bankrupt in about 10 years. There's a crazy lot of uncertainty around around like the bedrock of our retirement being there, but also like like we've we've entered a world of personal responsibility for retirement savings. You've got to save in your in your 401k and your I or things like that. And I think that that's a really good way to help individuals accumulate money for retirement. But you need to make sure they have access to a plan. But you know, kind of a bigger problem to some extent is okay, you get to retirement and you have, I don't know, a half a million dollars. It's like now what like you train these people to save for 30 or 40 years and all of a sudden you've got to figure out how you're going to spend down that money and you don't know how long you're going to live what the markets are going to do and it's so big of a big problem. So I think that we have a pretty good system, but it places a lot of responsibility on the shoulders of the average American. And that's where you know, having help having an advisor using certain tools or resources. I think that's really becoming more valuable because you only have one shot at retirement. You can't screw up. And so getting help to figure out what the best thing to do is just becoming I think more important for all of America. So you concern at all about a lack of generation beta actually appearing because childcare has gotten so expensive and it's so expensive to have kids. I know I don't need to tell you how much you have to say for college considering you have four of them. But it's just gotten so expensive and I know my generation fewer and fewer people are having kids. Is that a concern? So it was really interesting is one of the questions they asked was you know among those who aren't going to be having children like why is that? And so my wife is a veterinarian and and you know one of the top reasons was people are viewing their pets as a child. And you know if you follow this trend in other countries you see this in other places where individuals are kind of substituting having kids for having pets. And the number one said it reason often is just the costs and the time it takes to actually raise children. All right so we've just got a couple minutes left here and I am curious with all that is said and done all that we've talked about. You know what is kind of top of mind for you guys. You you guys invest like I don't know what are you thinking about this next generation is beta generation. So you know to be perfectly honest like I'm not incredibly worried about about one year one year old saving for retirement right I think that it's going to be it's going to be an issue I think I think what I'm what I'm what we're more focused on is individuals who are investing for today. So I spent a ton of time thinking about like how do we create solutions for individuals who are on retirement. And to me it does get to this earlier point just about where you know everyone's retirement is their own right and for better or for worse we all have to worry about the markets misbehaving about living a long time and it's just it's just really really complicated. So I think you know at a high level the job of all of us needs to be when we're young to make good financial choices to save in our 401k and invest well but but the decisions you've got to make when you get closer to retirement just are really really complex. And you know I'd like to think that things are going to get easier for generation beta but it's probably the opposite and so hopefully you know we can learn from a lot of the mistakes for better or for worse that individuals make today so that future generations as they retire have things that it is. I did a college calculator while I was away on break and oh for what's going to cost you for your kids not pretty. What's the number you came up with more than $600,000 for a private if you want to go to private school for one or for one for one good luck honey. All right David we got to leave it there. Hey listen thanks so much this was fun interesting and enlightening David Blanchett managing director portfolio manager and head of retirement research at PGM joining us from Lexington Conducky. No like that's one of the things we talk about all the time right the cost of college yeah it's just keep coming up and up and up and timidate. We'll see if it can keep going up and up and up I know 20 years ago you're probably saying that yeah exactly I don't know I don't know that I ever thought it but we've talked so many times like over the years about how it's been outpacing inflation and it just continues to do so.
