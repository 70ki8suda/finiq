Bloomberg Audio Studios Podcasts, Radio News This is Bloomberg Business Week, inside from the reporters and editors who bring you America's most trusted business magazine. Plus global business, finance and tech news. The Bloomberg Business Week podcast with Carol Maser and Tim Stenebeck from Bloomberg Radio. You want to talk next about the treasury and some security breaches that have happened that are concerning. America's debt levels poised to balloon beyond already record levels as we know in the year ahead. Leading to a decreasing number of primary dealers in the US treasury market. The decline of primary dealers and the rise of electronic trading have then led to concerns about the potential for just such breakdowns in the treasury market. Joining us now to discuss is Bloomberg's Michael McKenzie. Michael, several concerning headlines over the last few days. How can we be sure that the treasury, if it's not now, becomes impenetrable? It needs to be right? Absolutely. I think the US, whether it's exchanges, any kind of marketplace, they spend a lot of time and a lot of effort making sure they can be protected from hacking. I know covering equities more than 10, 15 years ago. All the major exchanges were on top of this. It was the only area that actually exchanges actually talk to each other. They actually agreed to work together. Normally, they're in a cut for a business of trying to grab IPOs. So I'm sure the treasury is on it. And again, it's just something that I think every company has to do this. All right. Are they also on it, Michael? I want to get to the story that you did with that Liz Kappa McCormick and Alex Harris about the pipeline, the primary dealers. And I feel like this gets into the wonkiness of falling the mortgage, right? Explain, explain, first of all, the role of primary dealers. Primary dealers system was created in 1960 by the New York Fed. New York Fed selects the primary dealers. And their job is to interact with the New York Fed market desk. So when the New York Fed does repo and all kinds of money market type operations on a daily basis, they're interacting with the primary dealers. Primary dealers then turn around and say, okay, if you want to buy and sell treasuries, where the registered market maker who does that for you, so you have a lot of big asset managers, hedge funds, all types of people who want to come in here and buy and sell treasuries, they normally go through the primary dealer market for the bulk of what they do. And what your story gets into that there's not as many as they're used to. So what are the concerns here? We've only got about a couple of minutes or so, but I want to get to the point because it's an important story. It's the kind of story that Bloomberg does so well that you do so well and explaining why we should care. Yeah, no, we should care because the real problem here is, yes, the number of primary dealers is shrunk, but a lot of that's due to solidation or we've had so many mergers since the heyday of the 1980s. What's really the problem here is that the amount of US treasury debt outstanding has just rocketed. It's gone up something like I think 15 billion in the last 10 years. And so at the moment, the treasury market is about 29 trillion. They think it could get to 50 trillion within the next 10 years if the presence pace of spending continues. So this really is a wake up call to people in Washington. You've got to get serious about spending. You've got to find new sources of revenues, IE taxes to kind of set all the system down because the system is showing signs of stress. Dealers can't really be as active as they used to be. That's partly because of the post-financial crisis regulation. So in the story, we sort of quote Jamie Dimon saying, look, we have a trillion dollars of cash we could put to use what we can't because regulators say we can't do that. So there's a real kind of tension here. And the genesis for this story was that, myself and Liz and Alex, we've been to a couple of conferences this year. And this is the number one issue is that the debt keeps going up. The primary deal of the system is instructed to work on the behalf of the treasury to sell debt smoothly, make sure there are no sort of blops and auctions, but they're coming under a lot more pressure. And if the debt continues to rise, this is a problem. And finally, if we look at the 10-year treasury yield, when the Fed began cutting rates in mid-September, that was yielding around 360. Today, it's closing out this year around 460. So it's risen a percentage point pretty much. Now, if you go into the walkiness of the bond market, about three quarters of that rise in the 10-year yield is due to a higher-term premium. And that term premiums what investors are demanding in terms of extra yield take down U.S. debt. And that's really a worrying sign. All right. All right. So just another thing to think about for 2025, where I feel like a lot of things are going to come at us. Michael, it's an incredible deep dive by you guys. And I highly recommend everybody check it out on bloomeric.com and on the bloomeric. Happy new year to our Michael. Happy years. Cheers. Yeah, V. Well, bloomeric's Michael McKenzie, you keep the watch on the rates market and certainly the treasury trade. Hey, we're going to stay with the treasury. Vony, you kicked it off. The story that really caught our attention yesterday, the U.S. Department, Treasury Department hacked by a Chinese state-sponsored actor through a third-party software service provider. It's how the world works. And yet you expect it to be safe and secure. Treasury, describing the situation as a major cybersecurity incident. For more on this and some thoughts, we are joined by Wendy Thomas, the CEO of Secure Works, a cybersecurity firms. Wendy, your thoughts when you saw and heard the story? Well, there's a few recurring themes that we've certainly talked about before, a vulnerability and a third-party technology that enabled these hackers to steal an authentication key by past security measures and access, treasury workstations and documents. And the theme of, well-known claimed credit for this attack, a high-profile Chinese state-sponsored cyber activity. So I think these are recurring themes, but certainly this is a major incident as we cap off this year. How do we know it's a Chinese state-sponsored actor? And if we do know that, if we have the tools to tell what kind of a hack it is, why can't we protect against that kind of hack? It is a good question. So the Treasury has confirmed that they've identified a number of indicators that do point to a China state-sponsored APT or a advanced persistent threat actor. The ways that you protect against this, whether you're a government or a business, remain the same. You have to be able to prevent everything that you can, but because we are so incredibly interconnected, via software, via supply chain vendors that are key part of doing business each day, we have to prevent as much as we can, but frankly be ready to detect and respond quickly. If you look at the date at which, beyond trust first, detected some anomalous activity, it was December 2nd. And we're sitting here on December 31st. The patches were issued sort of mid-month in December, you know, added to CISAs, known, exploited vulnerabilities catalog mid-December. It does take speed in order to one identify that something is hitting and to be able to protect. And that's a holistic approach of prevent, detect, and respond. Is there an argument that the public should have known sooner? I mean, when does the public get to know about such things? Well, there's been an increasing work, especially by the U.S. government, over the last couple of years, for organizations to report quickly, particularly if they are publicly traded companies. In this case, obviously a key government institution impacting our economy. But there is a bit of fog of war when you have a cyber attack and you detect something that's certainly anomalous, but you're not sure if it's malicious. And that's where companies like Secure Works come in to help quickly attribute anomalous activity to certain threat actors and to known, exploited vulnerabilities in order to protect the actual breach of information or documents or encryption through ransomware. Wendy, is this just a case of this is the environment we live in and China is going to hack into our systems. We're going to hack into Chinese systems and it's a digital world. It's a cloud-based world. This is just the way it is, despite cybersecurity companies like yourself and solutions out there. This is just the new reality or continued new reality. I think the reality is that the attacks will continue. Right as 2025 looms, we look to have continued heightened geopolitical tension, which could contribute to additional escalating cyber activity, particularly with China, whether that's increasing tariff policies that may come into play. The TikTok, TikTok January 19th deadline that's coming around the sale of the company. Does something like this make you think that TikTok, you understand the US concerns? Oh, absolutely. I think anybody using TikTok should do so with caution, whether they're an individual. I mean, the volume and variety of citizen data that TikTok is harvesting in order to feed its algorithm has concerns for all of us. That's why I think you've seen it first banned in government institutions where you can no longer mix personal use of TikTok with a government-used device. That is so terrifying. Is it worse than some of the American corporations and what they're harvesting? Well, it's a little bit different where we do have disclosures around the data that is being harvested and used for those algorithms and the opportunity to opt out. This is a this is a foreign power looking to harvest individual data. We don't really know what type of positioning for political or economic advantage that might be used for. Wendy, thank you so much for joining. That was very explanatory, very helpful. Thank you. That's Wendy Thomas, CEO of SecureWorks.

Pressure Metals and alternative money specialist at gold silver dot com. Alan Amizel start where does gold go and water its key risks in 2025. Yeah, thanks for having me. So I'm definitely expecting gold to have a great year in 2025 just like it did in 2024. I would not be surprised at all if it clears that $3,000 dollar announced threshold. And it could be the last year to buy gold under $3,000 announced. So in terms of the risk, what would prevent it from doing that? There's really two things that I see. One is actually Bitcoin. If capital is attracted to Bitcoin instead of gold, gold might not creep that high. And the other risk factor, which really isn't a risk factor, it's actually peace. It's world peace. If all the wars and conflicts in the world settle down and our leaders are actually able to negotiate peace, capital might not flow into gold like it has been throughout the last couple of years. So those are the two risks that I see. It's really gold is Bitcoin and peace. All right. So then for the run up that we've seen in 2024, Alan, is it because of the geopolitical concerns mostly, which we know gold has typically historically been a safe haven. But is that the reason why we've seen such the run up in your view? I think that's sort of the main underlying factor because it's that geopolitical uncertainty that causes so many other things. So we saw China buying a ton of gold. Not only is China the number one producer of gold in the world, it's also the number one importer of gold in the world. And that's very unusual. And investors around the world are also buying gold because of inflation. And the inflation is caused by all these countries who are fighting wars, running their printing presses. So if it weren't for the wars, they wouldn't be running the printing presses so heavily investors wouldn't be worried about inflation and they wouldn't be running to gold. So I think it really starts with all the geopolitical uncertainty. If we could all get along, we wouldn't have to buy gold. We could just live our lives. Well, Alan, you heard Mike McGlone there. We were speaking a little bit about crypto and he maintains that this idea of a strategic reserve is a Faustian bargain with the crypto people and the incoming president and the administration. Is that true in your view? Well, I think Bitcoin is best thought of as superior money. And any time that two different monies come up against each other, the same thing happens every single time throughout history. Capital flows from the weak money into the strong money and it's only a matter of time. So if you look at the United States and you want to discuss the strategic national Bitcoin reserve, is it a good idea? Is it a bad idea? Is it going to happen within the first 100 days or is it not even going to happen in the next four years? All of that doesn't really matter. Capital is definitely going to flow from weak money like the US dollar into strong money like Bitcoin. It's just a matter of time. I think you need to back that up a little bit. Why do you say Bitcoin is superior money? It's not even money. No offense. I have yet to transact in Bitcoin. And I think if you ask most people, unless you go to an emerging area, have yet to transact in Bitcoin. Yeah, it's a great question. I'm glad you asked and I could talk about it for hours, but I'll try to keep my answer short. There's really two ways to think about money. First is as a medium of exchange, which I would actually call a currency. So if you're going to buy a cup of coffee or groceries, you're going to use currency and you want something that moves quickly. It has low transaction fees and doesn't take a lot of energy to make that transaction. And the US dollar is great for that. The other reason you'd have money is as a store of value. And that basically means you acquire it and then you hold it for 10 years or 20 years. And it just sits there and you might even forget that you have it. But the whole point is for it to stay in one place and secure your value over time. That's gold and it's Bitcoin. So that when I say money, I'm referring to gold or Bitcoin, that store of value functionality, whereas a currency like the US dollar, that's more of a medium of exchange. So by the way, don't hold your breath on being able to use Bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee. It's not going to happen. It shouldn't happen. It doesn't matter. Why are you so convinced it's a store of value because the supply is finite? Does that make it a store of value necessarily? It's partly because the supply is finite. But more importantly, it gets increasingly more difficult to make another Bitcoin. That's so, so, so critical. That happens naturally with gold. No one has to design it that way. But if there's two different ounces of gold sitting in the ground and one's really easy to get to and one's really hard to get to, you're going to mine up the easy one. So later in the future, you're going to have to go after that hard one and spend more energy to get a unit of gold in the future. Bitcoin mimics that same property artificially using code so that it takes more and more and more energy to mine each subsequent Bitcoin. That's good news for anyone holding Bitcoin because if you acquired it earlier, it didn't take you that much energy to get it. However, anyone who wants to acquire a Bitcoin in the future has to give up a lot of energy to get one. I guess Alan, I would ask that if there's a limited supply, I understand the dynamics of supply and demand. But if there's a limited supply, how can it be something that is used much more broadly? I understand the value of maybe blockchain in terms of transacting, but the individual Bitcoin as a way of transacting. If it's going to be limited in supply forever, how can it be something that's much more broadly in use in terms of how we look at the US dollar or other currencies? Yeah, well, it sort of relates to my previous answer, which is that I wouldn't expect Bitcoin to be used in day-to-day transactions. Even if you develop something like the night lightning network or other layer two solutions, they're called, I don't think it'll be that common to actually transact Bitcoin. It will be more common to transact US dollars, euros, yen, and so forth, whatever jurisdiction you have. But Alan, didn't people say that about NFTs too? And they're not worth very much these days, are they? I would not go anywhere near NFTs. No, I only go near Bitcoin. I made a mistake going after a dozen other cryptos when I thought they had attractive use cases, but they're very hard to value, and they have real idiosyncratic risks. So I even went so far as to go visit one of these cryptocurrencies in person. I looked at their code, I met the team, I did my due diligence, and I lost 99.9% of my value on that coin, and I have multiple stories like that. These, most of these cryptocurrencies, they're not, well, some are designed to be scams. They're not all designed to be scams, but some of them turn out to be scams because they have so many idiosyncratic risks. You have to have execution on the part of the software team, you have to have marketing, you have to have adoption, you have to have functionality, you can't have problems, and you can't really have competitors that accomplish the same thing better than the way you accomplished it, or you're not going to attract capital. So, if you say Bitcoin is still in the process of price discovery, how do you discover a price when it's very unclear what the fundamentals are? Yeah, I mean, right, its value is that it's outside the establishment, and yet that lack of transparency raises so many questions. Well, Bitcoin is transparent. I mean, it's a public blockchain, right, so you can go and look online and see where all the blockchains are sitting, what the history of them has been, and what block they were mined. You can see all of that. So, transparency is actually pretty fantastic on Bitcoin. However, if I want to see how many dollars exist, I have to trust the Federal Reserve's data, and I don't, and it could be outdated, and I don't know who's holding those dollars or where they are. But I have the faith that the US government, and I know some could debate that right now, but nonetheless, you have the faith of the US government. Listen, this excitement, we know we could go on for probably another hour, means this is going to be a hot topic in 2025. Allen, thank you so much. Have a great new year. Allen Hibbert, precious metals and alternative money specialist over at GoldSilver.com. Alexa from our flagship New York station, just say Alexa, play Bloomberg 1130. The more on this group of pharmaceuticals, what to watch out for in 2025, we are joined by Bloomberg News Healthcare reporter Madison Muller, who is a must-read on all companies and developments in this space. Madison, good to have you here with us. I'm thinking about 2024, an explosive year, Bloomberg News wrote last week, 2024, was the year weight loss drugs took over. What was significant about 2024 after? What was it kind of a busy year for this space also in 2023? Yeah, 2024 was really the year that we saw the real world impacts of these drugs start to take shape. So it's not just talking about this, the clinical studies and how much percent weight loss and how great these drugs are, but we were actually seeing what happens when you put these out into the general population and the challenges with insurance coverage, the challenges with just affordability and access in general supply shortages. We also saw, as I know we've talked about on the show, the rise of telehealth companies that are making super copy or selling super copycat versions of the drugs and advertising them really widely on social media and the sort of battle that's ensued between the drug companies and the compounding pharmacies that make these copycat drugs. So there was a lot that was almost surprising or unexpected that happened when these drugs really got out into the world and I think 2024 was the year that that started taking shape. So where are we on supply demand, Madison, can people access them now who need them or want them? Yeah, so all from for most of 2024, both Novonortis and Eli Lilly really struggled to get a handle on the supply of their drugs. We saw wagovi and zepbound and ma'amjaro and ozempic in and out of shortage throughout the year. So toward the end of the year, Eli Lilly actually did get a handle on their supply and you know according to the US Food and Drug Administration, zepbound and ma'amjaro are not in shortage anymore but there is some ongoing litigation there because a group of compounding pharmacies are suing the FDA over this saying that the drugs still are in shortage. So the the drama on the saga is kind of continuing there. Novonortis drugs are still in short supply as of you know yesterday and today when we last checked the US FDA website but that being said, all of the doses are listed as available and so they've gotten a better handle on their supply as well. From talking to patients, some of the drugs are still hard to find just with different supply chain dynamics. So people are still seeking out these cheaper versions that are maybe more readily accessible through telehealth companies. Madison, how are you thinking about 2025? The company is to watch the executives to watch maybe the app starts to watch. Yeah, I mean 2025 is going to continue to be an exciting year. We have data from Eli Lilly's oral drug or for glipron that's coming in 2025. It's in late stage studies and that's going to be a pretty big deal because we've talked about how people want an oral version of these drugs. You know, the current medications are a weekly injection for a lot of people that's not super appealing, although for a lot of people it is because clearly there's no issue with demand for these products. But some people and in some other markets, pills are preferred and so we have a lot of companies that are trying to make oral versions of the drugs including Lilly and Novon. We have structure, viking, some smaller companies but Pfizer as well. And so Lilly has phase three data from their drug or for glipron that's coming out in 2025. And so we're going to see that. We're going to see some other companies coming out with data from other trials. The competition is going to continue heating up. And so insurance coverage is also a place to watch. We had the Biden administration propose a new rule that would allow Medicare, which is the government health insurance program for people over 65 to cover weight loss drugs. And so it will be up to the Trump administration in a few months whether to pass that or to block it. And so we could see Medicare begin to cover these drugs soon. And so that's an important development to watch as well. But sort of remains to be seen what will happen there. That would be a big relief to a lot of people. But more broadly, how are hospital structures, health insurers preparing for a potential raft of changes in regulation? We see the incoming administration with President incoming Trump nominating people like Marty McAree for FDA and Dave Weldon for CDC. These are people who've raised out about vaccines and other treatments. And of course, RFK Jr. potentially the new HHS Secretary. Yeah, I think that there's still a lot of uncertainty. With RFK Jr. in particular, he is someone, you know, staying on the topic of weight loss drugs has sort of come out against the pharmaceutical industry at large, but has also commented on OZembek and other GLP-1 drugs saying, you know, his his view is that the America's food system should be fixed before we turn to pharmaceutical interventions. And so that's, I know, been an area of uncertainty, but again, until he's actually, you know, confirmed, then we don't know what will happen. We don't know exactly what the policies will be. But there definitely has been a bit of uncertainty with some of the picks more so in particular than others. I know Dave Weldon is someone that has, you know, said a lot about vaccines in the past, Marty McAree actually is more is viewed as more industry friendly. So there's some it's a bit of a spectrum with the various picks and how how much uncertainty and how friendly they are going to be to the sector. And so I think that that's something again that we're going to have to watch early in 2025 and sort of see what policies they begin talking about whether these people are actually confirmed or not and go from there. Madison, man, we've had so many conversations with you and it almost feels like I joke with you that this is like the perfect drug that's going to kind of fix everything that ails all of us. Having said that, what's the thing you're someone who critically looks at this space? What is the thing that could go wrong? I mean, have they been tested long enough? Do we have to worry about safety concerns, longer term? Like, what is it? I think one of the things that we're actually already seeing go wrong and it might not be of, you know, the fault of the drug makers or the actual drugs themselves, but the widespread availability of these drugs, especially through telehealth companies and these super copycats that are being, you know, marketed and made by compounding pharmacies, they're getting into the hands of some people who shouldn't be using them, which, you know, generally, it's not maybe not a safety issue for someone who just wants to take one to lose a couple of pounds, even though they aren't the right, popularly, not these drugs are meant for, but I did a story a couple of weeks ago about people with eating disorders that are actually getting access to these drugs, right, through telehealth companies that don't really have checks in place to make sure that the right people are getting them and not something that's a little concerning. Came across that and prepping for this chat. Good stuff. As always, medicine, happy new year. Vanguard is working hard to balance opportunity and risk for investors in this time of volatile yields.

And so that's contributed to a very strong flow environment for U.S. equities. That can continue in the shorter term, but typically that's a contrarian indicator. And I think some of this weakness into your end is just some of the fraud coming out of the market. All right, so what's the focal point for you, Matt, when you look at the markets, I'm just thinking about that Fed meeting on January 31st. You've got economic news. You've got JP Morgan kicking off earnings on January 15th. You've got the inauguration. What's key for you, especially when I think about, you know, what ultimately supports equities and continued gains? Yeah, I think the path of inflation in 2025 is what we're going to watch the closest. And the reason I bring that up is, you know, the path of interest rates and the level of interest rates has really dictated winners and losers in the economy as well as in the markets. And what I mean by that is you look at kind of higher for longer who that helps and who that hurts. It's really how they're affected by interest rates. And so larger companies that have turned out debt haven't really seen interest cost increase at all since the Fed started to hike rates. And that's not the case for smaller companies that are more tied to floating rate debt. And you can also use the same analogy to consumers, wealthier consumers that own their own homes or have locked in mortgages around 3% and excess savings are earning higher interest rates on those savings. That's not the case for lower income Americans that are more affected by inflation and are feeling the pinch of higher credit card rates as well as higher automobile rates. And so if inflationary trends were to kind of resume they're downward trend that we saw in the front half and the middle parts of 2024 and into 2025. You know, you think that gives the Fed more room to start cutting rates, which hopefully allows the economy to broaden back out and broader market participation to take place into next year. You know, we can see that happen. We also can see a higher for longer kind of sticky inflation dynamic also happened. And so if you're an investor, the question is how do you position for kind of some of this uncertainty at kind of both ends of the spectrum? And I think the good news is that if you look at the fixed income markets today, we're seeing near 20 year highs in real interest rates. And so that is something that we think investors can do a lot of good by positioning themselves towards that as the class is a little bit more than maybe their best part levels would dictate. And then furthermore, if there is this broadening out that takes place, if the inflationary trends resume as we kind of look forward to the next calendar year, we think some of the smaller cap, make cap areas of US equities are pretty attractive here. For a couple of reasons, first and foremost, their price more attractively than US large caps. And secondly, if you look at kind of we're earning set for these asset classes relative to kind of the high bar that we're putting place in a couple of years ago, we think the path forward towards a rebound in earnings is a little bit easier than kind of the continued march forward that we've seen for earnings estimates in large caps, which are really reluctant on higher profit margins. Does any of this depend on the Fed cutting rates more than at least once next year? I think it does require the Fed to continue on their easing path, more than just one or two cuts. And that's why the inflationary dynamics are so critical as we think about the path forward in 2025. The back and forth and inflation dynamics have kind of caught on investors off sides all year. We started 2024 with six to seven cuts priced into the forward curve. And we're ending this year with just one or two cuts priced into the forward curve. And so the path forward for inflation, I think, is the critical place to watch in terms of where market leadership has headed. You know, I just want to go back to small caps. I mean, man, I feel like people have been calling for that small cap outperformance or mid cap outperformance. And I'm just looking on my Bloomberg, just comparing the past few years at the S&P 500 versus the Russell 2000. It's been really hard. And I understand the S&P 500 influenced by some of those big mega cap tech names, but nonetheless, hard to kind of beat that outperformance. I think that's right. And I think there's a couple of things going on there. One is kind of how interest rates impact the earnings and fundamentals of smaller companies, relative to larger companies. But the other is what you touched on there. Just the phenomenal growth levels we see in the Mag 7. If you look at it just the top 10 of the S&P 500 today, it's roughly 40% of the index. And just five years ago, it was roughly 23% of the index. And so these higher cap weighted names are having even greater impact in terms of the performance of the S&P 500. And fundamentally, that's where the growth has been as well. And so if you look the last couple of years, it certainly makes fundamental sense and monetary sense why US large caps have led. The question is, is if you look for it to next count year, does that narrow? I think for the first time, is you're sitting kind of looking at kind of what's priced in and what's expected, the gap between the Mag 7 earnings growth and the rest of the market is starting to look kind of more more compressed versus where we were as we started 2024. And where we were when we started 2023. And so whether that comes to fruition or not, I think we'll dictate whether or not this US large capout performance can continue into next year. We shall see, we shall see. And whether or not, once again, we have another year where fundamentally those big tech names or big mega caps really kind of lead the way.

There are two kinds of people in the world. People who think about climate change and people who are doing something about it. On the ZERO podcast, we talk to both kinds of people. People you've heard of, like Bill Gates. I'm looking at what the world has to do to get to zero. Not using climate as a moral crusade. And Justin Trudeau. There are still people who are hell-bent on reversing our approach on fighting climate change. And the creative minds you have to do creative minds you haven't heard of yet. Really don't need to have a tomato in December. It's going to taste like nothing anyway. Just don't do it. What we've made here is inspired by Shark Skin. It is much more simplified than actual Shark Skin. Drillian industry has come up with some of the most creative job types.
