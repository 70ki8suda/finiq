Welcome to the Bloomberg Daybreak Asia Podcast. I'm Doug Krizner. 2025 is often running with trading underway in the Asia Pacific after Wall Street's first session of the new year. It is a market holiday in Japan. In a moment we'll be speaking with Jay Hatfield, CEO and CIO at Infrastructure Capital Management. But first, we're following developments in South Korea. At this hour, anti-corruption investigators are seeking to arrest impeached President Yun Sook Yul at his residence in Seoul. Now, YonHap News is reporting officials are attempting to exercise a warrant for Yun. His lawyers call the warrant, quote, invalid. YonHap also reports that a South Korean military unit prevented those officials from entering the building. Stay with the Bloomberg platforms for the latest developments in South Korea. We turn our focus back to markets. Joining us now is Eva Lee. She is head of Greater China Equities at UBS Global Wealth Management. Eva joins us from our studios in Hong Kong. Good morning to you and happy new year. I'm glad you could make time to chat with us. You and I were talking a moment ago about how busy the fourth quarter was, especially the month of December for your business. What was the reason for that, do you think? Well, I guess, you know, Trump being elected, everyone expect a lot of changes to happen after he assumed the President's office, which is the third week of Jen. So, in fact, our, you know, CIO, UBSIO, had revised down the expectation in terms of interest rate cuts to 50 bips for 2025. Obviously, we already had the December rate cut as expected. But originally, we were at 100 business point cut. Now we reduced to 50 business points. So that will have a big impact across the board, which is like the US dollar, the expectation in terms of strengthening of the beginning and also the other currency. How much of a rate cut, particularly in Asia, how much of a rate cuts that they will have as a result. So all these would impact, of course, even impact gold and, you know, all the bond yield and everything. So that's why we want to have our client prepare, you know, have the portfolio positioned accordingly. So you're in Hong Kong. What are you hearing about the economic situation on the mainland right now? Is the consumer still lacking in confidence to such a degree that domestic demand will kind of remain in a slump? Or are there signs of maybe things turning just a bit more positively? The December number definitely better than expected. But if you dissect or break it down, what really driving the growth was the manufacturing activities, the export side seems to be better. Having said that, people were sort of saying, oh yeah, because they want to, you know, get all the export done before Trump put into tariffs. But on the other hand, probably sales seems to be better in December, but that was mainly in T01 city. Lord here cities remains weak. So back to your questions, consumption sentiment remains weak. I think structurally, you know, we have these property, you know, sales overall is still not yet, you know, sort of full recover of reviving. And then on the other hand, the local government born seems to be, you know, sort of they already have a solution, so to resolve that. But still the overall in terms of empowerment, the prospects people feeling is not as promising as, you know, a few years back. So consumption as a result still weak. Like, of course, the auto sales were strong. The home appliances were strong. That was because of subsidies. But apart from that, it's still weak. So what do you advise and clients to do then in an environment like this, particularly for clients in Asia? Are you directing them away from the region and into places like the US? That was occasionally, definitely would be crucial. Our, you know, sort of as allocation positioning for China's neutral for US, it's recorded attractive. So you are more or less, you know, can imagine, you know, deep, sort of positioning that recommend. I mean, the fact is we cannot, we know that China valuation is cheap, you know, attractive or undemanding how you put it. But the tariff risks, it's definitely ahead. Now it's not about whether tariff will, whether we will have a tariff hike or not. It's how much that will be. So I think that's why the, these sort of derating, multiple derating risks is still there, or the pressure is still there. But on the other hand, on the, in the US side, you know, the copper earnings has been better than expected. The investments in AI continue. We have two themes, AI power resources. These are the two, you know, so a big theme that will continue to drive girls in US market. As an petarget, we said at 6600 by the end of next year. So, sorry, this year. So, you know, all these, you know, making us, you know, recommend investors diversify, not just inequities, but equity spawns. But on the, equity side, we favor US. What about the technology story in China? Are there signs that it's beginning to develop in such a way, maybe because of the restrictions that have been coming from the United States, those export controls on things like advanced semiconductor technology? Are you seeing the beginnings of another leg up, maybe, for technology in China? Well, I mean, the technology in China, you name it as like the e-commerce, the gaming portal. You know, these stocks actually have been under pressure due to the fact that they are proxy of China. So, people, these stocks get short, particularly from overseas investors, when there are, you know, worry and concerns about the macro. On the chip side, like you're talking about semiconductor and all that, yes, I mean, if, you know, US has, it's going to impose any restrictions in terms of advance, you know, chip that with effect China, or the broadening, you know, the export restrictions onto these sort of chip exports that we're going to affect China. But I think that's already somehow expected by the market. And the diversification of supply chains away from the mainland to countries, maybe like Indonesia or Vietnam or even India. I mean, is this something that's going to be a continued theme in 2025? We've got to be very careful. It depends on how China is going to impose all these, you know, tariff impact because he has been saying, you know, can say 60% tariff on US as our own China, but 10% on the rest of the world. If this is the 10% on the rest of the world, I don't think the market have fully prized in. And that would definitely affect, you know, the places that you mentioned because of Vietnam Indonesia, particularly Vietnam. If you compare to 2018 till now, there is actually a significant increase in terms of export to US. While on the same time, they, if you look at the data, they also have input on a lot of materials from China. So you can look at it. It's like a core style, you know, China manufacturing platform. So if US, you know, sort of look at this data and sort of target Vietnam will be affected or some other regions that have been, you know, receiving this diversification, some manufacturing platforms from China will also be affected. So Eva, I'm curious. You seem to be questioning a lot. There's a lot of uncertainty. I get that. I'm curious about how much cash you're sitting on right now, waiting for opportunities, maybe for the dust to settle and reveal some things that may look attractive to you. Are you holding a fair amount of cash these days or is most of the money that people have given you to put to work already been allocated? You know, our theme within CIO is always stay invested. It's very difficult to time the market. So how we do it, it's a week, you know, we diversify that across equity, bonds and private. So alternative investment is a big thing. So we can rely on, you know, some of these very professional hedge fund managers, pirate equities, pirate debt managers, they not being affected that much by the up and downed oil system market. And in fact, on the other hand, they able to invest while people sort of say put so that and plus they can react very quickly. So this is a theme that we actually have been pushing even before COVID. And in fact, it worked really well, particularly in the downtown East Side 2021-22. So that's the way we go pursue in particular in these sort of all-time moments. Eva, I know that you're head of greater China equities for UBS global wealth management. But if you can, give me a little bit of your perspective on the political instability that's happening right now in South Korea. I was struck today by the fact that the equity market is rallying in the face of the fact that we are being told that the impeached president Yun Suk-yul is facing a rest. Hard to maybe understand the two as they are juxtaposed, but I'm wondering broadly speaking, when you look at the South Korean market, what do you take away? In fact, if you look at Fundamental, people always sort of look at the tax side with just the Taiwan and Korea markets. And in fact, the clear divergence, like Taiwan market obviously have all-performed Korea market by large. And that was relating to the trip side, which I cannot mention in company, but you know who, which one I'm talking about. And as a result, the divergence is actually because of that, but the company in Taiwan is able, we need to, you know, ride on that AI-chipped, very advanced-chipped technology. And that's why the South Korea company seems to be sort of locked behind. So this Fundamental actually explained the divergence and also potentially the continual of one market outperforming the other. This regardless of, you know, it's sort of the political situation or the evaluation. I think that is something we should focus on rather than. Obviously, the political side would affect. There was another element of it. But I think since this, you know, happened in Mauritius Lorde Curfee or whatever, that already, people already expect some changes of political instability in Korea market. We'll leave it there. Eva, it's always a pleasure. Thank you for visiting with us and happy New Year to you all the best for 2025.

Joining us now is Jay Hatfield. He is the CEO and CIO at Infrastructure Capital Management. Jay joins us from here in New York City. Jay, thanks for being with us. Happy New Year to you. What did you make of today's price action on the first day of trading in the States? Happy New Year Doug. What we thought was actually, what was happening last week was just a normal rebalance. So big pension funds, buying bonds and selling stocks. So we had actually that was going to reverse earlier in the morning before Tesla announced there's shortfall and deliveries and not really caused the futures to drop and destabilize the NASDAQ. So we had a pretty big drop for a while. But we think that as soon as we get into earning season next week, then we will, the market will start rallying and stabilize. Before you don't have earnings, you get a lot of volatility around very little information. One of the other things I think that the market's been struggling with is the notion of far few arrayed cuts from the Fed in the New Year. And I was struck by that GDP forecast, the Atlanta Fed's GDP now model estimating real growth at 26. Yes, that's down from 3-1 from last week. But am I wrong here? 26 is still pretty healthy. And absolutely is, we do think though that that direction is going to continue. The, what the Fed is missing is their hawkish rhetoric has caused really the only important financial condition to blow out. So we had a 90 basis points increase in the 10 year. We're already in a housing recession. We think that's going to worsen. So we think that unless rates drop, we're going to have only growth of 1 to 2 percent in the first half of this year. And then the Fed will relent. We actually think there will be four cuts this year and the 10 year will end below four. So how are you setting yourself up for 2025 then, given everything that you just kind of sketched out there? So we have a 7,000 target, but that is contingent on rates dropping and a 18 percent corporate tax rate. We do think that at least on a risk adjusted basis that yield and value stocks will outperform. Particularly, our number one call is investment banks. You know, the large caps are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, those are some of the biggest holdings in our I cap fund. But we think there's going to be two more legs to the stool this year, an M&A boom because of deregulation on the antitrust side. But also we think there's going to be, particularly in the second half, a AI IPO boom that we haven't seen yet. So we're forecasting 30 percent above consensus estimates for Goldman Sachs, for instance. So we're super bold up on the investment banks. If you look at what happened since early 2023, so for all of 23 and 24, I think the S&P 500 was up by more than 50 percent. Do you have some projection as to what we may see from the S&P in 2025? Absolutely. So we have a 7,000 target, which is roughly 16 percent return. The normal return is 10 percent. So if we didn't get that, we don't get that corporate tax reduction. So we use the terminal to get consensus 26 earnings because of course, if you have a year end 25 target, you use 26 estimates. But that number is only 305. So to get to 7,000, we're adjusting that up to correct for the fact that corporate taxes are lower. So it's about a 320 estimate. So that's the math. We do think we can hold this multiple. That's quite high. If we get lower rates and if we get a continued A, I'd, so we think 3,000, 7,000 is the most reasonable target right now. So if you're thinking there are possibly four rate cuts from the Fed in the year ahead, I'm going to imagine that there are a few screaming buys in the bond market. Am I wrong about that? Well, we do think that we favor, you know, our biggest fund is PFFA. It's like two thirds of our assets. That's a preferred stock fund. We think the riskier portion of fixed income will do really well because that's where you want to be. When rates are dropping or at least stable and the stock market's strong, you want to have spread product that typically tightens when the stock market is rallying. So we think that preferred stock and high yield bonds, which are pretty similar asset classes, will both outperform other asset classes within fixed income. We were talking a moment ago about the fact that maybe there are opportunities in financials and I'm wondering about kind of the real estate situation, particularly commercial. We've talked in the past about how the office complex is still in dire straits. Is this an area of concern for you still or are you not in an environment where you expect rates to fall? Do you think some of that risk will be a little bit mitigated by those falling rates? Well, we've added non-consensus call, which has been correct for 24 that the office freak out was overdone. Not to say that for B&C offices, that's a huge problem, but keep in mind most of the REITs that are public-retreated have A buildings. Similar to all the most of the buildings in mid-Tam and Manhattan, like Bloomberg headquarters or where we're headquartered. So we've been correct about that part of it. The reason I didn't highlight that as our number one call is that I do believe that it's now dependent on rates going lower to really good returns. So that's probably our most controversial call as the rates are going to go down. Investments banks will do fine. Other banks might not if rates are higher. Reads won't do that well. Small caps won't do that well. So our call that non-Tuck will at least keep up with the tech sector is dependent on lower rates. Okay. So declining rates, then I'm thinking immediately weaker dollar. And then I'm looking to markets offshore, and particularly those in Asia, and I'm thinking, okay, valuations that are relatively low compared to the US. If the dollar were to weak, and I want to be a buyer of risk assets in Asia, do I not? Well, there's no question that rates and the dollar are linked. So that's why we don't think we can stay where we are at this 450 level with a 9% appreciation because it's hugely deflationary in the US. It's inflationary overseas. We still think the US is the best place to be. No one else has the technology that we have. And we're bullish on Broadcom. We're bullish on Amazon. And you really can't find those companies in the rest of the world. So we wouldn't buy the whole any one market. If there's an idea there, we don't cover a lot of international stocks, but if there's an idea there, fine. But I think it's best to be in the US, participate in the most capitalist country, one of the most capitalist countries in the world with definitely the best technology. Are you generally optimistic about the policies that the incoming Trump administration is going to deliver? Well, we're actually at the polar opposite view of consensus. Specifically, we think that tariffs, we're not a huge fan of tariffs, but if they do happen, they're actually deflationary because it's just a one time increase. And then it reduces demand because it's like a sales tax. And you can use those proceeds to cut corporate taxes. So we have the opposite view of consensus on that. We also believe that if you really listen to what the Trump administration is proposing, they're proposing to deport criminals. And there's some discussion of expanding H1B visas. So those two combined would be very deflationary because you get college educated immigrants coming in and producing more GDP. So we think that most of the concerns about the Trump policies are political talking points left over from the election. Jay will leave it there. Always a pleasure to have a chance to visit with you all the best for the new year.
