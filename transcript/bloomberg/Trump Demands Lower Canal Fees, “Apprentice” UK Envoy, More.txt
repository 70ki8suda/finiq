 News when you want it with Bloomberg News Now. I'm Ed Kaleinghi. President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that the Panama Canal is charging absorbent in prices and rates of passage on U.S. naval and merchant ships. And he is demanded that fees be lowered, or else Panama should return the canal to the U.S. Quote, the fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous, especially knowing the extraordinary generosity that has been bestowed to Panama by the U.S. Trump said this in a post on his Truth Social platform. He continued, this complete ripoff of our country will immediately stop. The U.S. is the canal's biggest customer, responsible for about three-quarters of the cargo transiting through each year. A prolonged drought, however, has happened the canal's ability to move ships between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. President-elect Trump has named Mark Burnett, the man who created the television show The League of Prentice, which helped catapult Trump to the presidency as a special envoy to the UK. Quote, with a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role. Trump said this on a post on Truth Social. The position of special envoy to the UK doesn't currently exist. Trump has already named investment banker Warren Stevens as his ambassador to the Court of St. James, a highly coveted diplomatic post that usually goes to top campaign donors. Amazon workers that the company's sole unionized warehouse in the U.S. have joined a broader strike by the international brotherhood of teamsters. We get more from Bloomberg's Denise Pellegrini. The teamsters affiliated Amazon Labor Union with Trump's own workers at the JFK warehouse in New York City, Staten Island, is asking members to walk off the job. Video on X shows people already marching from the union's office to the warehouse through the snow. They want Amazon to hold talks with workers there and at other facilities where Amazon employees or drivers have sought to be represented by the teamsters. The teamsters earlier this week asked workers at seven last mile delivery warehouses in California, Georgia, Illinois and New York to strike beginning Thursday. It's the biggest test yet of the union's organizing campaign. Companies spokesperson says so far the strike has not impacted deliveries. Denise Pellegrini Bloomberg Radio. The top uniformed police officer in the New York City Police Department has resigned. In mid allegations he demanded sex from a subordinate in exchange for opportunities to earn extra pay. Police Commissioner Jessica Tish, except for the resignation of Chief of Department Jeffrey Mattry Friday night effective immediately. John Shill, the department's Chief of Patrol, will take over as interim Chief of Department and Philip Rivera will assume Shill's duties as the head of the patrol division.

A lawyer for his accuser, Lieutenant Quartisha Epps said the move was overdue. It's looking like another record for holiday travel. We get that story from Bloomberg's Charlie Pellegrini. The Auto Club Triple A is predicting that more than 119 million people will travel at least 50 miles from home through New Year's Day, which would top the previous holiday season high set in 2019. The two weekends on either side of Christmas look to be some of the most crowded times on the road and at airports. The trade group airlines from America also foresees record travel, saying it expects airlines to carry 54 million passengers during a 19-day period that began last Thursday and will end Monday, January 6. This number would represent a 6% increase over last year in New York, Charlie Pellegrini.
