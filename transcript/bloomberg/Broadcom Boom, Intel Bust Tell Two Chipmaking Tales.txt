Companies including Nvidia and Broadcom reaching new highs, not everyone that was sharing in the good fortune. Intel, as we know, a story we talked throughout the year, falling sharply in 2024 as the company contended with losses and grim forecasts and really trying to figure its way forward. For more, we are joined by someone who knows the semi space like no other. Bloomberg, semiconductor and networking reporter Ian King joining us on this money Monday. Ian, good to have you here with Fanny and me. I do want to start with Intel. I do wonder if 2025 is going to be the year where it figures itself out. I don't know, how are you thinking about it as we get ready to kick off a new year? Yeah, no, it's a huge question right now. It doesn't even have a CEO, remember? We still don't even know who is going to lead this company forward. The last thing we heard from its two co-CEOs, who are the interim appointees, was that, is the company going to be broken up? We don't know, that'll be for something that whoever takes the CEO role will decide. So that's even the existence of this company. As it currently is, as it always has been, even that's a question at this point. What's its expertise in now, Ian? Sorry, I... It's expertise. What would it be bought for? Well, historically, it had one of the strongest design teams and microprocessors. Still owns a huge percentage of the PC market in terms of market share. Still owns a big percentage of the server market in terms of market share. And it used to have the best factories in the world. All of those bright and shiny things are a little bit duller these days, unfortunately. But there's still, in many respects, an intrinsic value in that capacity and those engineering. Hey, one thing I do think about, Ian, is, what kind of leader does Intel need going forward? You know, we've talked a lot about it, you know, the insider versus the outsider. And I do wonder what is the kind of leader that this company needs to compete in this and video world, if you will, and video-dominated world, at least at this moment? No, I mean, that's the question. And I think once the board decide who that is, the type of choice they make will be a really important indicator as to what they see is the future of this company. If they look to sort of replace Pat Gelsinger, the outgoing CEO with somebody similar, somebody who knows the company, somebody who's committed to keeping it together, then that's the sign that they're still believers. If they looked perhaps bringing an outsider, somebody who's perhaps towards the end of their career, who kind of knows the industry in general has all the contacts, maybe that's because they see it as a breakup situation at this point. And then, of course, Ian, you have the other side of the coin. Let's take Broadcom, for example. We waited all year long and then suddenly Broadcom had this resurgence. 25% move in one day alone. What's behind that revitalization of Broadcom? Yeah, I mean, you've got Hock Tan, the CEO there, who's made this kind of company out of sort of the leftover parts of other companies. He sort of identified what he sees as these kind of stayed but strong franchises. And that's been the atmosphere surrounding this company. We got that all of a sudden. It's like, bang, we're exploding with growth. Because Broadcom does the design work for companies like Google who want to make their own semiconductors and what he's saying is, hey, I've got a pessimistic view of chips overall, but guess what? This sector is amazing. Is Broadcom, Ian, potentially the company we talk more about in 2025 over Nvidia? Difficult to say, if you look at the raw numbers, no. Broadcom's projecting massive growth, an available market of as much as I think 90 billion by 2027 for it's AI-related chip designs, Nvidia is already there. Right? Nvidia this year is going to have a data center division that's going to be somewhere in the $120 billion and that's just one division. So clearly Nvidia is already there. Clearly we all have a long way to go to get even closer them, but the one that appears to be closest at this point is, would be Broadcom. So Nvidia is one of the stocks that is higher today, Ian and I are seeing right across the screen, and partially I would imagine because of this acquisition and Israeli software company. Tell us a little bit about one AI and what it will do for Nvidia. Yeah, I mean this is a software acquisition. This software from this Israeli startup helps owners of data centers to get the best out of their infrastructure to sort of coordinate it to make sure the utilization is up to make sure the software is being balanced in the right way. This kind of intermediary role, which is very important when you're spending tens of thousands of dollars per chip. So that's very useful for Nvidia. And there was some concerns that Nvidia because of its market influence, because of its size, just wouldn't be able to get anything past regulators. That's obviously not the case. It's obviously been able to close this deal. And it's shown that Nvidia perhaps still has room to do deals and to be able to sort of make moves and influence the industry externally. Hey Ian, one quick last question, 45 seconds here. I am curious. We've talked so much about the semi-conductor cycles, right? Where there's lots of demand, then there's the build up, and then there's oversupply. Will the AI semi-cycle be the same thing, or is it something different this time? Every time, I mean, Scarlett likes to point out how long I've been covering this industry. I've been listening to CEOs telling me this time is different for most of those 25 years, and that's never been the case. So why would that change now? Fair enough. I will definitely, whatever you say, I'm going to follow it. Ian, thank you so much. Happy holidays. Happy New Year. Ian, King of course, Bloomberg, semiconductor, and networking reporter. All right, folks, we just taught it. Of course, about semis with Ian. 2024 was once again a year about artificial intelligence in a big way. Check out one measure on that. If you look at the $2.6 billion global X funds, global X artificial intelligence and technology ETF, it's up about 26% year to date, and that's after a 55% gain in 2023. So the question at this point is, can it outperform for a third year in a row? Let's get some thoughts on that. We welcome Xenomr, Senior Research Analyst, to verify. Xenom, good to have you here with Vani and me. Strongyear in 2024. Strongyear in 2023. Much stronger in 2023. What's your investment outlook for AI-related investing come 2025? Do you have any clarity on that? I think it's clear at this point to most people and viewers of the show that AI is coming down the pipeline in every facet of society. It's not just chat interfaces. It's advanced, you know, autonomous vehicles. It's logistics. It's, you know, human, you know, we're advancing to the next kind of phase of human tech interaction. It's not just going to be locked in the screen. It's going to be real time with us. You know, we had the iPhone in 2007, maybe wireless earbuds and then chat GPT. And now, you know, from a consumer enterprise government, industrial standpoint, we're starting to see kind of the AI-focation of everything. And to be clear, there's still a lot of challenges and roadblocks ahead for deployment and implementation. There's new safeguards. There's new challenges that occur when you start to automate more, you know, human society isn't perfect. We operate off communication and assumptions and ledgers and things of our own. You know, AI and robots, for example, also depend on real time and accumulated knowledge to make decision both from an individual basis, as well as, you know, a societal basis. And so what we expect to see is continued implementation of AI and robotics that, you know, we expect to start to continue to eat the world to kind of paraphrase Mark Andriesen. And that's definitely something that we don't expect to slow down at all, especially when you consider some of the policies and global dynamics that are happening right now. Sure, but what kind of return on investment will it provide, and specifically for investors and companies that are making those investments? Is there a case for waiting to see what it can actually do in terms of the bottom line? Well, I mean, if you look at, you know, just to look at how Wall Street's looking at it classically projected top and bottom lines for AI and robotics companies are both projected to continue to accelerate next year. Now, Nvidia might start to, you know, grow into its accelerated growth that's been going on since, you know, October 2022 or, you know, November since when it bottomed out. But, you know, these end markets are expected to grow rapidly. I mean, we're talking about, you know, majority of GDP starting to be AI and robotics driven. That's a huge, you know, you're talking about the tan of the world that you can reverse engineer tasks and processes and everything else. So you, if you break down the stack of what AI or robotics are, let's talk about, you know, cerebral digital automation and all the connectivity and data storage that happens on that side and the physical inputs, right, we're, we're physics bound and then physical automation, which is even less automated. There's a lot of sub-sectors within those that are that are that are parts of that sensors, for example, as we start to have robots that can connect and do more rather than just static and non dynamic, we're going to have dynamic robots with more skills higher adoption rates because they can do more. The payback periods are going to be better both for, you know, manufacturers right now. There's a lot of push to move away from China. So we've got Vietnam, India and even US. A lot of people are saying like, hey, why don't we build more here? We've got very low robotics penetration rates here. You know, we're 10th in the world and the world of the United States. There's a lot of room to grow. And if we actually want to be able to match parity of cost and make this efficient for everybody, we have to we have to do more there. So, Zeno, walk us through then. How does my life maybe change as a result of what you're saying? How does Bonnie's life? How does everybody who's listening and watching their life change maybe in 2025 as a result of what you're saying? This collaboration between AI and robotics. Well, some of it will be less obvious in behind the scenes, right? Like how food and deliveries get to you, right? When you were we're used to pressing a button and magically things appear. So kind of continue like, let's go a step further, right? Navigating around your home, for example, we have promotes and automatic doors and dispensers and things like that. But what's the next level of that, right? You know, meta, for example, is working on interfaces that combine your real-time vision and potentially a risk-warened sensor that allows you to navigate your environment. Now, this could be huge for elderly and parents, disabled, other people, as well as everyone else. On the other side, personal AI assistance, I think we'll start to take off a little bit more and a more impactful way in 2025. You've seen Gem and I do this. It starts connecting to your calendar, your goal is your budget. It's not exactly there yet, but kind of a more simple way is just even open AI's latest and others ability to look at a scene and ask questions. It's kind of there's a lag period. We'll start to see that in front time disappear. Maybe we'll even see that full AI capability on that specific device, whether it's a glasses or a camera on your phone. And that allows you to basically have kind of like a personal AI assistant, life coach or trainer or just kind of this omnipresent, all-knowing thing that can help you solve whatever problem you have. Are there companies that have been overlooked so far in this bull-run companies that are doing some of the things you just laid out? Well, there's certainly a lot of companies that are putting their hat in the ring. There's public and private companies to be clear. You've got humanoid robots that are coming. That's one form factor of many to be clear. You might not even have humanoid be the form factor in your home. It might be on a base or the stand in a telescopic arm and things that do chores for you. So we probably will have an iPhone-like moment or Chatchee PT moment in the next year or two to say 2025 might be a bit bullish, but it's coming. You're seeing lots of companies working on it. I think at this point because things are moving so fast, it's almost better to have a basket of companies that are that have exposure. And if you have AI and autonomous vehicles that take off, you need cloud connectivity, because they're not just operating as a lone device, they're networked. So they depend on inputs and sensors. And so a lot of these components, like actuation, computer vision, I would almost look at it as leaders of these sub-sectors that make a lot of sense to get access to how we're seeing the majority of the GDP transforming into a more automated world. Hey Zeno, I do wonder, do we make the leap of AI having its own agency? We talk a lot about autonomous agents and basically AI, not needing human intervention to respond, react. Just got about 30 seconds. Do we hear more about that in 2025? Because it feels like that's the next big step. Yeah, AI agents and mixture of experts, we're going to see a lot of advances here. Clearly AI can start to solve problems on its own. We saw O3 from Open AI come out. We're seeing open source AI come out with new models. And ultimately AI agents will certainly start to be utilized more in 2025. There's no question about it. It's going to start again, open source or even just directed AI will start to eat the world. And AI agents is certainly a big part, but a slice of that pie. Well Zeno, we will no doubt be talking to you again then in 2025. I'm looking forward to what happy new year to you. I'm not looking forward to the agent or the personal AI assistant that says, do you really need those new shoes? I'm just not worried about how much they get. They can't invade your life. I totally agree. Although I bought the new iPhone, the ones that spoke to the AI capabilities. I don't know. I do not notice any difference. And with Zeno, Mercer, there are senior research analysts and verify joining us. Vanguard is working hard to balance opportunity and risk for investors in this time of volatile yields.

And that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. There are two kinds of people in the world. People who think about climate change and people who are doing something about it. On the Zeno podcast, we talk to both kinds of people. People you've heard of, like Bill Gates. I'm looking at what the world has to do to get to zero. Not using climate as a moral crusade. And Justin Trudeau. There are still people who are hell-bent on reversing our approach on fighting climate change. And the creative minds you haven't heard of yet. Really don't need to have a tomato in December.

Let's turn out to Lauren Zidell Baker who is economist at ITR economics and Lauren will start with the most recent data out today. Dallas Fed manufacturing activity coming in strong 3.4. We were anticipating a decline for December and pending home sales month over month up 2.2% year-over-year of 5.6% less strong but nevertheless getting up there. What concerns do you have? Let's start there with the US economy for 2025. So we see actually good news ahead for the economy. So my concerns are really limited to these black swan type events. So something like tariff policy as Matt mentioned really could constrain it could cause them upward pricing for a US consumer that's already been very squeezed by inflation could cause some additional hindrances for businesses here. But overall the foundational pieces are in place for a very resilient economy. So I don't see any underlying cracks now later into 2025. That's when we at ITR economics do see inflation starting to build again. Some of those inflationary pressures already in place. So something that has been squeezing both consumers and businesses could even cause the Fed to stop decreasing rates potentially even start raising them again by the end of next year. But those impacts would probably be felt more strongly by 2026 or 7. So all signs really pointing to good news ahead in the year to come. All right. I want to go back to how you started black swan events whether it's tariffs because if anything we've learned over the last decade or so or two decades is that black swan events actually do happen and I've had a couple in my lifetime whether it's the great financial crisis or whether it's the global pandemic. So when you say that what in particular is it what kind of trade war we see what is it in particular that you are so most worried about? The big ones for me are all geopolitical. So if we see wars right increasing tensions or conflicts globally that is the big one that we just couldn't really predict. I'm an economist not a geopolitical analyst but other than that we do see the trade war especially if we get reciprocal tariffs on some broad based US tariffs that could hinder some global trade activities. Now globally we are sort of seeing the pendulum swing away from globalization back toward nationalism. There are certainly some benefits especially to US manufacturers a lot of foreign direct investment flowing into the United States but this is just tipping the scale. So there will be winners and there will be losers of this tear of policy of changes right to the trade policy. It's a more a matter of which side of the table you're sitting on certainly some opportunities for some but it does also cause that disruption which could have those unintended consequences economy-wide. And can't make things more expensive correct? I mean this is what I want to worry about the inflationary pressures. Yeah I want to be clear we see fundamental reasons for inflation coming back next year on top of the tariffs tariffs would really just boost that level of price rise but at the end of the day tariffs do tend to be inflationary we have really good case studies historically from either the 2018 round of tariffs. Even domestic producers do tend to increase their own prices when they get that room from their foreign competition being priced up so I would expect this is building on what we already see as again fundamentally resurgent inflation. So we've seen quite the rebound in yields. Treasuries just really having the most phenomenally awkward and strange year. Lauren Neildotto is saying today the rise in yields is about the term premium going up and that's because of deficit concerns. He sort of puts away the idea that it's anything to do with economic growth. What do you think? I think there's a real case for the market just putting its hand on the scale in this case. So we've seen even things like government you know kind of funding treasury levels mortgage rates with certainly we we think would be driven by something like the federal funds rate but seem much more closely correlated especially this cycle with those those treasury yields and just not reacting in quite the same way to the Fed funds rate as they have historically. So there is certainly a lot of money at play right the kind of differential between global central bank policy is coming into effect here but overall the U.S. is still a very good place to do business. Anytime we get that additional risk premium right we are the gold standard so I see why yields have reacted in the way they will. Deficit concerns I'm watching those in the I'll call it medium term. I'm looking toward 2030 to be where we really have to do something about this debt level something about this deficit that's when I see the problem coming to an abrupt end but in the very near term the U.S. is still the gold standard so this technically yes is what we consider right the risk premium. When you think about Lauren doing something about the deficit okay we have been here before but it does feel like it's something different and the pressure is certainly building and if it means cutting the deficit that means either cutting programs or cutting spending somewhere and I do wonder about and worry about the economic impact. So how do you see this potentially playing out and the impact on the U.S. economy that might result? No good answer to that question there are a lot of different things we could do from cutting programs raising taxes to monetizing the debt to defaulting on the debt right throw our hands in the air and just just say we're done with it. None of those would be pain free for the U.S. economy some would be clearly more painful than others but at this point with our debt burden being so high with our deficit really growing year after year contributing to more and more debt with higher interest rates today just the mere interest payments on our national debt are a huge and growing problem again contributing to that higher and higher deficit spending year after year it seems like we're far enough down this road that there just isn't any easy answer anymore. It never is easy Lauren thank you so much Lauren is economist at ITR economics.

Bloomberg 1130 president Biden said he'll order a state funeral in the capital for Jimmy Carter calling the former democratic president who died sunday an extraordinary leader statesman and humanitarian joining us now to talk about this and Jimmy Carter's place in the presidential history if you will and really his legacy after he was out of the white house is barber parry university virginia's miller center presidential oral history program co chair so nice to have you here with vani and myself barber my understanding is that Jimmy Carter was the first president that you voted for take us back to then and tell us how you are thinking about the former president today oh well first fall thank you for having me and I do think of it very personally because I saw Jimmy Carter when he was certainly Jimmy who in 1973 he was here for a democratic conference of governors from the democratic party and I was a high schooler and I was selected as a page to help with that meeting and people you know didn't pay too much of attention to him then in terms of a presidential candidate but by 1975 he came back to Louisville for an issues convention for the democrats and by that time eight other people had joined him to run for the nomination of the democratic party in 1976 since I knew that was going to be the first election I voted in I was really looking for a candidate and I thought all the other people these eight other people who were big names in the country and around the world and they had been in Washington for years but I was really impressed with Jimmy Carter I kept an open mind he spoke about foreign affairs which wouldn't have been an area of expertise for him but he had traveled all over the world and he obviously had a very good mind so I thought well this is somebody who could maybe be in the mix and sure enough he won the Iowa caucuses and then went on to win the nomination and just improperly went on to win the presidency in 1976 and I decided to go to his inaugural so it was freezing cold it was so cold the Potomac River froze over but I had a warm feeling because he did something very different he he got out of the limousine and he in Rosalind walked hand in hand from the Capitol all the way to the White House with their family behind them and that was the first time the president had done that it really did make them seem like they were of the people it's pretty impossible to do counterfactuals but what if he had had a second term oh you know it's it's a fascinating question isn't it I love counterfactuals I think that the country wouldn't necessarily have been better often by that I mean that the economy was not good when he left office that was one of the main reasons he lost to Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter while we think of him I think now in terms of his positive contributions as a post president there was a side to him maybe that came from his Christian background that was sort of a dark side and a light side and his dark side was tended to be a little bit lecturing and hectoring of the American people and that was not Ronald Reagan and what we needed in 1980 was a positive view and that's what Ronald Reagan brought to the United States and so I don't know if we would necessarily have been better off as a country but we certainly were better off as a country to have Jimmy Carter in a post presidency yeah and having said that and this is something we talked about with our David Weston I mean you think about him bringing awareness to energy conservation the solar panels on the roof of the White House creating the Department of Education there's a lot of things that he did that I think we credit maybe to the Reagan administration that he actually started to put initially into into work yes well it turned out that his lecture to the American people the so-called misnamed malaise beach was he never used the term malaise but it was a crisis that he was calling Americans to face but instead of doing it in a more positive way that an FDR Reagan might have done again it was a bit too negative for the American taste and particularly since right after that he got rid of most of his cabinet so it made people feel like things were a bit unstable so yes he did the things you just mentioned and he also upgraded our defenses during the Cold War that obviously Ronald Reagan could could work on that and in the end thanks goodness under George Bush the first and the cold war so I do think that there were many positives from the Carter administration but there were just some unlucky events that he either mishandled or wasn't able to handle and that brought Ronald Reagan to power Barbara we're out of time but is there a lineage do you see any politicians out there that are carrying on a Jimmy Carter type legacy I do and it's Joe Biden and as he said yesterday decency decency decency that's what he took from Jimmy Carter and that is Joe Biden where that will go come this January 20th is hard to say that's for sure all right Barbara thank you so much for giving us your time today and he was the first president she voted for as well Carol I love that story and just taking us back there but it's the point of him and his moral compass is certainly something that in this division that we are seeing and money and politics and so many things that seem to get in the way it's just something to really think about in in this current environment like down exactly that was Barbara Perry University of Virginia's Miller Center presidential oral history program co-chair
