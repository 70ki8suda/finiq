Plus global business, finance and tech news. The Bloomberg Business Week podcast with Carol Maser and Tim Stenebeck from Bloomberg Radio. We learned today as well, Alex, that US consumer confidence dropped to a five-month low in December driven by concerns over the economy and potential Trump policies. In a survey by the conference board, 46% of respondents expected tariffs to raise their cost of living. Joining us now to discuss is the researcher behind the report, Dana Peterson, chief economist at the conference board. So Dana, I mentioned those numbers. Present situation was fine. It came in at 140.2, just a little bit down from 140.9 the previous month. But expectations were down almost 11 points, down from 92.3 to 81.1. How concerned should we be? Well, certainly the present situation, as you said, was only a tick downward. But the expectations really fell backward after several months of improvement. And it was across all three components of that, that's business conditions, what they think about employment six months ahead and also incomes. Was that shown on party lines at all? I'm just wondering because a lot of it was led by the tariff increase expectation, right? Well, we did ask a special question about what consumers are thinking about in terms of policy for next year. And certainly many of them are concerned about tariffs and whether or not tariffs are going to be inflationary or not. And indeed, in the right ends where we ask consumers what's the most important thing that you think will impact the economy, good or bad, certainly prices left up inflation to the top, but also not long-at, not far after that. We're certainly elections, presidents, and also the word tariff actually surge from zero to something notably positive. So consumers are paying attention to what's going on in politics. And they're starting at least they're curious to know what that's going to mean for their bottom lines. Yeah, I mean, it's more fodder for the federal reserve, right? To continue to focus on inflation or to refocus on inflation again, as opposed to the unemployment part of the mandate, which it looked like they had been at least swerving towards. Well, it seems like it is something that FOMC participants, at least some of them, according to Chair Powell, are looking at and did fold in their expectations of what policy might look like next year and the impacts on the consumer. Certainly, we have the debt ceiling rolling around. We have the tax cliff of 2026 that's going to need to be dealt with. And certainly, there are the threats of renewed or at least intensified trading wars, trade wars because certainly the tariffs that were put in place years ago were never lifted. And we could see more that again, we'll impact consumers because companies that have to pay those tariffs here in the US are just going to pass on those costs to the consumer. That's sort of also my question on that. Is that this data was very different from the rest of the surveys that we've gotten on the consumer. And I'm wondering why you think that's different and why the feeling then that maybe the tariffs will get passed on to the consumers. I'm thinking about you, Mish. For example, there was some stockpiling and sort of buying now and not later because of tariffs. But what did you make of the negativity in your report versus other surveys? Well, I mean, again, just looking at the headline, it's made up of five different indicators. Two are about business, two are about the employment situation now in the future and the other ones about income. So when you put all those things together, as I mentioned, business, employment and income were down. But the index itself does not reflect anything about politics. So we're understanding the thoughts that consumers are interested or and some of them are concerned from our special question that we asked and also from the writings, which we usually do report on. So, you know, all the writings were pretty mixed. Some said that they were excited about what's going to happen next year. Others weren't. But certainly, I think consumers who have just experienced a lot of inflation and prices are certainly much higher now than they were before the pandemic are focused on inflation. And certainly the risks around that come from things that are already putting up pressure on inflation, including insurance, labor costs from labor shortages, also housing costs aren't falling as fast as we want. But there's also potential for some things that might be inflationary in 2025. And they're all focused on that right now. Just briefly, Dana, what did you make of the rest of the data out today? We had new home sales for November not as good as anticipated, but still higher. Yeah, so actually when we asked consumers about whether or not they're going to purchase homes, we've seen a little bit of an improvement of the last six months, but it's still pretty low. But the good news is that despite the fact that consumers are concerned or worried or thinking about the next year, they still plan to buy. They're still planning on buying cars, especially use cars, but also new cars. They're planning on going on vacation a little bit less, but if they go on vacation, they're looking to go on international vacations. And when it comes to services, they're still looking at experiential services like going to the movies or streaming or going to hotels and restaurants and that sort of thing. So despite whatever they're worried about, consumers still think that right now it's easy to find the job. And as long as they are working, we think that they're going to continue to spend and potentially that spending will lean against some of the downside risks that we see for next year. Yes. All right, Dana. Thanks a lot. Really appreciate Dana Peterson and Chief Economist at the conference board.

Well, let's continue the conversation now with Andrew Graham who is managing partner at Jackson Square Capital. Andrew, we've been talking about targets on the S&B 500 and how really, except for maybe stifle and maybe one or two other houses are pretty much all higher from here for next year. What are you looking for out of this S&P which let me just remind everybody is up like 50% over the last two years. Yeah, and fully valued, you know, sort of a multiple basis forward multiple now. We're going on 26 numbers and you're still at 20 times forward estimates in 2026. So what we're trying to do is just apply, you know, sort of a conservative earnings growth figure above 9%, which is conservative. It's less than consensus, which is in the low, whatever, 11 and 12%. So put 9% on top of that, maybe 6500 is a conservative target for us, at least, for at least us anyway. Well, yeah, and then considering that, you know, we have 6700, there's some $7,000 call. So I can argue that that would be conservative. What's going to be the biggest mover, do you think, for that 6500 call? Is it going to be policy from TC? Is it going to be Fed or is it going to be bottoms up? I expected to be policy from DC, you know, generally speaking, I think we're going to go with the US economic resilience theme still. There's no reason to doubt that. We see that, you know, happening in a higher for longer rate environment, you know, reinforced by supportive domestic policy, more expansion of the business cycle, solid labor market still, and a broadening AI cycle, which I think is really important, I think, for viewers and listeners to pay attention to. So the pro business policies also may be lower energy prices, stronger capital markets, more deal activity, but the path, I think, to the policy change is going to be bumpier than most people expect, and the markets are vulnerable because a lot of that good news is priced in. You know, under many of our guests today, you talked about AI again being a theme next year, and you know, to look at the market today, there was no reason to suspect that it won't be a theme next year in a positive theme for the market. At the same time, you have to wonder if something else won't come along and ousted out of its prime position. I think you may be quantum computing. We saw a little taste of that today. Yeah, I'm trying not to get distracted by the quantum computing thing because I think it's probably further out, but getting back to the, yeah, betting back to the AI cycle, which I think everybody's looking for monetization in places other than semiconductors and equipment that goes into data centers. There's been a lot of emphasis, I think, in the media on AI scaling laws breaking down. I think that's wrong. I wouldn't buy into that at all, and I see these agentic models getting faster, and they're being signs of monetization all over the place. There were certainly signs in service now as most recent earnings report, and I expect to see the same thing crop up in sales in CRM sales force when they report earnings maybe in the summer. So we see this growing and not slowing down, and we expect software to be the primary beneficiary. What kind of names do you like? Well, we would mention service now, sales force, and then maybe as honorable mentions HubSpot and Workday at some point going forward, those are among the bigger names. Cybersecurity is also going to be a consistent theme, and we see CyberArc as a beneficiary with their Venet-Venify acquisition, kind of getting into a positive agentic solution cycle. They have machine access management at the core of their business, and we see that as a potential winner going forward. We're trying to emphasize software over semiconductors. We own a lot of semiconductors. We think that sort of phase one of the AI cycle, phase two goes into software, and we saw that show up like I said in service now, and we see that happening more and more in the coming year. Presumably, if you did all that work, you also looked at energy and energy to power AI and all of that, and obviously you came away with the notion that perhaps there wasn't any value to be had there. No, absolutely. I mean, that's an area that we're invested in. Vistra is a stock that we own independent power producer, but also vertive in, you know, sort of a leader in data center cooling, a leader, I think, in liquid cooling. They have an opportunity to double their offerings in 2025, and that's a stock that we like a lot. So, we're there. We just think that the dispersion or the difference between the performance, between semiconductors and software is so wide right now, and we think the cycle trends that way, and so we're trying to get more exposure and to software specifically. What dense this on a macro level, what makes you worried for these kind of calls? You know, I think, you know, the big change that the margin, margin last week was the the Fed meeting. It was the updated median 2025 dot. I thought consensus, you know, was looking for two or three rate cuts suggested by the dots, and it was an unambiguous two rate cuts, you know, sort of a dot. The pattern was centered right there in the middle, and I think that was the thing that markets were most disappointed with, and maybe a hawkish tilt. And so, if the Fed is maybe less inclined to cut rates, and I think they'll pause in January, they might, again, you know, let's say some disinflation progress, they'll pause again in March. The next right-rate cut on our on paper here is is June, but that would that set you up for some some growth disappointment. So if growth data disappoints or something along those lines, I expect markets to be more sensitive thinking to the Fed, you know, is not maybe as eager to cut interest rates. I don't want to take away from the fact that Fed put is clearly in place. And, you know, from our opinion, it's in place, but I don't think it's a tailwind. I think it's more of a floor. Got it. All right, Andrew, thanks a lot. Really appreciate good stuff. Andrew Graham managing partner at Jackson Square Capital, adjoining us on the markets.

Just say Alexa play Bloomberg 1130. Certain logistics and shipping companies are going to have a really good view into what that actually winds up looking like. So we wanted to get the take on that with the CEO of RX. So Drew Wilkerson, he joins us now. So there's a lot going on with you Drew. You guys have been really busy lately in September. You finally absorbed coyote logistics. So that was quite a hurdle. You also are looking forward to 2025 in terms of demand growth and tariff questions. You're stocked those down from from late November by like 25%. What's going on with you guys? What are some of the highlights? As you mentioned, we closed the acquisition of coyote. We actually closed it fairly fast. When you look at it from time of announcement to when we close, we close it within just a couple of months. And this is a transformational acquisition for us. It more than doubles our truck brokerage making us the third largest truck brokerage in North America. Sets us up really good for growth because when we were doing due diligence, one of the things we looked at was the customer overlap. And there was not a lot of customer overlap. And we're going to get more exposure into some verticals that we weren't as strong in like food and beverage from that acquisition. So really excited. We're in the early days, but so far as far out seating far exceeding our expectations. So you look at the likes of these Amazon strikes very closely. I'm sure. And what do you see for the future of labor costs and the potential for any disruptions like that down the pike? Yeah. And transportation anytime that there's a disruption or volatility and actually creates a good thing on the transportation industry as you start to see tender rejection and rise. And from from that standpoint, you set yourself up in a position to be able to get spot loads and projects as others are falling off of it. So as things like that and calls disruption in the market for us, this actually the volatility is a good thing for our business. Volatility may be good, but questions and visibility on tariffs may not be. How are you guys preparing for next year? We're watching it extremely closely on what's going to happen from from a tariff perspective. And overall long term, you know, what it will do is it will drive more domestic transportation. And for us, that's a good thing. We're the majority of our business. Over 90% of our business is done entry US. So for us, the more that you see onsoring into the US, it creates more transportation opportunities for us to be able to capitalize on. What are your margins like and how can you expand them? We saw obviously, you know, FedEx and the likes of USPS and so on trying to do the very same. And I'm just curious, you know, particularly at a time when you're trying to make acquisitions, are there ways that you can cut costs? Yeah. And when you look at one of the things that we've been doing, we've been an early adopter in technology and the transportation industry. If you go back and you look over the last decade, our margins have been some of the strongest in the industry. It's because we've invested so much into these pricing algorithms that allow us to have optimal pricing to both the customer and to the carrier. So we're going to continue to focus on technology and use it as a way to expand our margin, but also increase our employee productivity. If you look over the last 12 months, our employee productivity is up 15%. And so for us, if we're able to be able to do it and we're able to increase our loads per person per day, then ultimately that will increase our overall margins. But when you look at say the tariff situation and you add that into your goals, like who pays for those tariffs? I mean, do you guys do it? Does the end consumer do it? And if the end consumer, I would think that hurts demand. If it's you guys, I would think that that hurts your margins. Yeah, I think that that's still unknown. Ultimately, I think it'll be hard for it not to be passed down to the end consumer. If there was a rise in price that ultimately that would go back to the end consumer, but again, something that we're watching very closely. Yeah, but you do have president, right? There were tariffs put on last time around and some of those tariffs didn't come off during the Biden administration. So how has it impacted your business already? Yeah, so if you go back to the last Trump administration, it was actually a robust transportation cycle for us. And there were highs and lows throughout the four years. But overall, it was a strong transportation market. And some of the tariffs that you saw put on with China led to more domestic and more US Mexico trade. So our Mexico business has been up, you're roughly 30% whenever we saw businesses shift from China into Mexico. So are you worried if we get tariffs on Mexico that's going to mess you guys up? We're watching it very mostly. But again, if there's more domestic loads and more domestic volume that goes out there, that's a good thing for us overall. But obviously, if we're hurt for our trade partners to the north or to the south, it's something that could have an impact on that volume and shift it to more domestic volume. You're the broker, right? But I'm sure gas prices impact you and how much your your services are needed. So how important is it for the likes of RXO that gas prices stay low? We watch fuel prices very, very closely, but ultimately for us, fuel prices are more of a pass through from the customer to the carrier as a broker. Can we talk about your stock for a second? And I appreciate you're the CEO. So you're going to be like, I don't know why the stock is down 25% in the last month. We're fantastic. I get that. But why is your stock down 25% in the last month? I think overall, if you go back and you listened to our earnings call, we said that this was going to be a muted peak season. And we were one of the first to say that this was going to be a muted peak season. And I think people are starting to see that play out. Now, with the way that we measure the stock is what it does over the long term. And if you look over the last 24 months, it's up over 20%. And you know, for a cyclical market that's at the bottom of the cycle and been there for over two and a half years, we've got happy investors with how we perform throughout the market. And we're not watching the stock price on a day-to-day basis. We're really watching to see what it's able to do on a one, two, three-year basis. You know, we've been through a year where we've seen continuing wars. We've seen any number of elections. We've seen huge geopolitical turmoil and changes and so on. And you compete with the global companies. You compete with Chinese companies. You compete with Middle Eastern shippers and so on. I'm sure how does the prospects of maybe a commerce 2025 help your business as a tailwind? Well, first I would say remember, we're largely a North American based company. So what we're doing is transportation that is largely driven by truckload and LTL across North America. So a lot of the companies that you're referencing aren't necessarily who we're competing with on a day-to-day basis. But when you look at what it does is it would bring stability to overall forecasting. And it allows us to be able to forecast because if you go over the last three years, forecasting has been off when you look at where people have projected volumes to come in for the industry overall. Drew, thank you so much for fascinating conversation and please keep in touch because I imagine it to be quite the year-to-year for you guys next year and for all freight brokerages and shippers in general as well. Drew Wilkerson, CEO of RxO, thank you so much. Vanguard is working hard to balance opportunity and risk for investors in this time of volatile yields.

Well, no holiday season would be complete without the iconic elf on the shelf, the company. Behind the timeless brands, when working all year round to produce new products and entertainment value. Now remember, this is how the story on the elf on the shelf goes. Every night, this Santa's scout elves fly to the North Pole to report to Santa every day in December. If children have been behaving or misbehaving in the next morning, they wind up in a different spot. Just sort of see the real deal and check out what kids are actually doing. While joining us now for more on this, the co founders and co CEOs of the Luma Stella company, Christopher Pitts and Shanda Bell. Shanda is also the chief marketing officer. Guys, happy Christmas. This is always such a fun tradition for Elf on the shelf, particularly if you have kids. Crystal, let's just start with you. How are things going this year? It's busy. I mean, we like in our world to actually looting the sleigh on Christmas Eve. So up until the very last moment, we are working hard to make sure children feel all of the love and all of the joy on Christmas morning that every parent dreams for their family. Crystal, I mean, it's kind of genius. You took Christmas and made it something that you basically own. What's next for Luma Stella? Well, next year we're very excited to announce that we are launching our very first ever chapter book. Children all over the world write us and say, what are the Elves? Eat. Give us all the scoop on how Santa became magical. And how did the Elves get their magic? And so because we have become the source of that information and we are owning the world of Santa Claus, the chapter book is going to answer a lot of those questions for kids. And we're really excited about that partnership with Harper Colin. So that drops in September. What do they eat? That's a brilliant. I love that. Hey, Shanda, as a chief marketing officer, do you feel like Elf and the shelf markets itself at this point or how much more work do you need to do to be like, no, we need to have more penetration here for Elf and the shelf? That's a great question. It's a little bit of both, right? So certainly social media has taken on its own, you know, vibrato. And but it's really our job as a company to listen to our consumers. And the best way to do that is through social media. So that's how we continue to serve out new products. We certainly want to listen. But we also have a lot of questions that people want answered directly from the brand. So it can be anything from to Christus Point, you know, backstory type questions about the Santaverse and the lore of all the other characters that we have to offer from Elf babies this year in Frost Pips or we have Little Grant, our new Little Yeti. Elf pets are super popular. So we hang on. It's like, what's Elf and a Yeti is? Oh my gosh, Elf pets are amazing. So they each have their own animated special on Netflix and Elf pets really teach children about faith, hope and love. So we use characters that kids love and imbue values that parents love. And so they have their own jobs for Santa Claus and help him make his journey on Christmas Eve using the values of faith, hope and love. Explained me how, you know, is there a part of the sort of coming up with all of these ideas at which point you have to pay somebody for the IP? I mean, can you just tack yourselves on to the Santa mythology, for example, and sort of owners without actually paying anybody? How does that all work? That's a great question too. So this year we launched the Santaverse, she consumers. And really it's the entire enchanted world of Santa Claus. So it's every friend, it's every foe, it's an entire world of storytelling. And really every Elf has its own story to tell Santa and Mrs. Claus, all the Elf pets, they all have their own stories. And each one is unique to every family that adopts it. So that's a reason to you. But then do you have to, is there anybody out there that owns any of this or is it in sort of the public domain, if you know what I mean? Is there any copyright or is there any, I don't know, a state of Santa Claus anywhere? I don't know. So we certainly have copyright and trade more protection on all the the things that we can, that we work with Santa Claus to produce and to come up with. You know, but it's, it's an amazing mythology. It's the greatest mythology of our time that no one's really taken the time to explain. And nobody's in a better position to do that than us. So if this amazing hero brand that's in, you know, 28 million homes all around the world, and people do look to us for the answers. They want to know the mythology of Santa Claus. And in this entire world, this entire fantastical universe. And so it's our job as a company with 120 employees that all work for Santa to answer those questions. So we're Bloomberg. So we're going to ask the business questions along with all the fun stuff. If we get any kind of tariff increase, how does that affect Christa, what you guys do? Are you all manufactured in house in the US? Walk us through that. Yes. You know, I had the pleasure of being on Bloomberg a little earlier this year with Vani and I explained that while we fully support our governments' efforts to secure fair trade agreements as balanced trade is great for everyone, it's important to note that in our case as a small to medium sized business, tariffs can significantly impact a business like ours. Small businesses, consumers are going to bear the brunt of those costs. And for us, it's also because we can only bear so much. So just like in the supply chain crisis, we were able to hold our own and to really stabilize our prices. But at some point, it's going to have to pass on to the consumer. So absolutely as a company that sources and manufacturers are own goods and ultimately is in charge of our own supply chain, tariffs can hurt small businesses. And the additional thing to that to think about is that when you're looking at these tariffs and in this particular situation, the companies that are going to benefit the most are the companies that are out in the world of counterfeit. They're the world of imposter. They're the world of doops because they aren't following any of the same laws or rules that we are. Their goods come in usually small parcel package overnight. And then that's how they are going out into the market. And so with companies like ours and other companies, these tariffs, if they happen and there's still a lot to be seen, could be very impactful. How do you contract those doops? I'm curious because it's not even for sure that even a big huge website like Amazon, for example, can really get rid of all of them. Yeah, it's a struggle for Amazon. We have an entire team of people internally that work tirelessly to get cease and desist letters out and to ensure that our IP is protected and that truly the real brands that we've spent our life building are the ones you see when you search on their platform. And they've struggled with this for years. It's definitely something we spend hours and hours focused on. We've struggled with people landing on our adwords, buying them up. And then you can't even find the actual products. It's something the industry is going to have to tackle. We're going to have to tackle it head on because imposter's and doops, they're dangerous. Many of them are not safety tested. Many of them are getting into the hands and the homes and families. And it's absolutely bad for all of us when that becomes the case. I think Vonning just really wants to know like who owns Santa. I redo. I think before that, I think this is like her quest now. Like who owns a Santa for this. Shanda, if we take a look at your partners, we just had a nice piece out that showed, you know, Netflix, one of your partners, etc. How do you guys work with them throughout the year? What are those partnerships? How valuable are they to you? Yeah, our partners are certainly a big huge part of what we do, right? We want to offer the best in consumer products, entertainment, and experiences for our fans. And so relying on these partners, especially Kellogg's, McDonald's for example, they might offer an experience for families. Like we offer joyful family moments. And so getting that toy in a happy meal, for example, in Australia and in the UK, where that program is live as well as, you know, getting your fun little, you know, elf on the shelf cereal, the kids love that. It makes fun. All ideas. So we help families create joyful, family moments through these partnerships. Taylor, for example, they do scavenger hunts in the mall and things like that. So these are our vital partnerships. Clearly entertainment for any type of property like our own is invaluable. So we have an elf story as well as all three elf pets that we actually produced in house, all streaming on Netflix. So these partnerships are really valuable to us. You can't have a global intellectual property and not have entertainment for children to answer all the questions that they ask, but it definitely keeps us busy. But we're honored to have them this part. So I think the elves and the reindeer and Santa take off from Finland somewhere tonight around, you know, after two in the morning, I think, and then we can track them, right? And I'm curious. And what happens once, once, once Santa is on his way for you guys? What's the very next thing that you do after you wake up? Well, we're hopefully asleep. We're much like the elves. We're much like the elves, we're really, really tired. And we have worked really hard, 365 days a year to pull off, you know, the Christmas season for our fans. So we are exhausted. Our, our company and employees are exhausted. They have worked full time just like the elves do for Santa Claus. So hopefully everybody got a little bit of a break. And then early January, we were back at it again. Did the elves drink alcohol? I get it, do. Right? I'm here. I mean, so it's a big self-disgolveneer. So it's going to be a big, all-acorporate party then with the elves and yourselves after on Christmas Day, when we're old. I mean, if you've ever managed a child during Christmas, you definitely have cocktails. Thanks a lot, really appreciate it. Happy holidays to you, Christopher Pitts and Shandabelle co-founders and co-CEOs of the Lumestellac Company. This is the Bloomberg Business Week podcast.
