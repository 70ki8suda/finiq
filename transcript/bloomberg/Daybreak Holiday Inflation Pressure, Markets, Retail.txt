Markets are closed for this holiday. I'm Nathan Hager. Coming up this hour, it has been another banner year for the bulls on Wall Street. Well, the new year brings as many happy returns for equity investors as 2024. We will bring you a special stock roundtable with Laurie Calvacina, head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets and Cameron Dawson, Chief Investment Officer at New Edge Wealth. Plus, we're wrapping up the most wonderful time of the year for retailers. So who were the big winners? We'll ask retail analyst, Bert Flickinger, Managing Director at Strategic Resource Group. First, we want to focus on the economy as a whole. The Federal Reserve is coming off its final rate cut of the year. J. Powell and company surprised Wall Street, not with the interest rate reduction, but when they changed years and put their policy focus back on inflation. Once again, we've had a year on projection for inflation and it's kind of fallen apart as we approached the end of the year. So that is certainly a large factor in people's thinking. I can tell you that might be the single biggest factor is inflation has once again under performed relative to expectations. It's still going to be between two and a half and three. It's way below where it was, but we really want to see progress on inflation. And that was Fared Chair J. Powell last week following the Central Bank's final policy decision of 2024. So what's in store for next year? To answer that, we're pleased to welcome Tom Porcelli, Chief US economist at P. Jim Fixed Income. Tom, great to have you with us on this holiday. And I hate to say inflation has been persistent, but are we going to see progress? Well, good to be with you Nathan as always. And I think let's, I would reframe it a little bit. We have seen a lot of progress. I mean, if you just look at, I don't know, pick your flavor of inflation. But if you were just look at core PCE, core PCU is what? His height is nearly 6%. And we're down to what, 2.8% now. So there's been quite a lot of progress from an inflation perspective. And what was interesting about Powell's press conference at the recent FOMC meeting was he acknowledged, I think, a number of the things that are challenges from an inflation perspective that we can exclude from inflation. Like, so shelter is a great example. They and we all recognize that there are these calculation challenges from a shelter perspective. So you remove it. And you know, this is how the whole super core idea sort of came to be. Well, what I would say is I'm not a huge fan of super core because I think it also strips out the things that are deflating. And I don't know why you do that. It's part of the consumable basket. So that, that to me just seems a little intellectually disingenuous. So what I would say is this, just take headline inflation, take core inflation, strip out shelter. And when you do that, what you see is that inflation is actually pretty tame, right? So if we just use CPI as an example of that, you know, like headline CPI is running out well 1.6% pace X shelter. And core CPI is running out of 2.1% pace X shelter. So, you know, I was a little bothered by the idea of this notion of sticky inflation. I mean, I think a lot of this expected inflation would remain relatively elevated, relative to target. But we continue to drift in the right direction. And I'm sorry, I'll say one last thing on this, Nathan, and then I'll stop. You know, I think about not just the idea of, of, of stripping out shelter, but let's acknowledge that in real time, shelter prices are slowing. So that will continue to act as a sort of, as a weight on inflation, as that continues to slow down. But maybe more important, when I look at wages, the direction of travel for wages, I think is pretty clear. I mean, just look at quick rates that are, you know, sort of getting cloud-bird. You know, that's yet another factor that I think we do not have to worry about, because wages will continue to slow. So I think the inflation story is at least a bit more benign than what Powell suggested. So are you thinking then that the Fed could be more open to accelerating the pace of rate cuts? More than they said they were planning to last week when they surprised the market with this expectation of just two cuts for all of next year. Yeah, I think this is the one thing that I actually did agree with Powell on. I think that, you know, look, as a central banker, you know, you, you relish optionality. And, and I think you're, and you're supposed to, because you want the flexibility to be able to adjust as, as the backdrop sort of evolved. So I've, I've ton of sympathy for that. So the short answer is yes. I think you're, you're absolutely supposed to acknowledge that you could see a faster pace of rate cuts. And, and indeed, you could certainly see a slower pace depending on how the data evolved. But I think again, the problem for me is he kept on Powell, kept on talking about, you know, data dependency. But I, I don't know if that's quite what it is. I, and I don't want to split hairs on this. But it really strikes me more as data-point dependency. And that to me is a problem. And it's a problem because we all know this, right? I mean, we could do, we could do an entire segment on this, one point alone. The data have been very volatile more so than what we've seen, certainly pre pre COVID. And so think about the coming, you know, in the next couple of weeks, we're going to get what? We're going to get a payroll report, and then we're going to get a CPI report. What if you get a clunker? Right? What if you get a clunker of a payroll report? The market is then going to immediately start to sort of build in the idea of, oh, well, maybe the idea is going to have to do more. So I think this is, this is part of the problem with data-point dependency. Speaking with Tom Porceley, Chief U.S. economist at PGM fixed income. So what should the bed be focusing on then, Tom? I mean, at the meeting last week, it seemed as though Fed Chair Powell was really laser focused now on inflation as opposed to potential risks to the labor market. Should they be taking a more holistic approach? I think that's exactly right. I mean, look, they are a dual mandate central bank. I think that you're supposed to be focused on both of these. Now, both of these parts of the mandate. Now, of course, we all recognize that there are points where, you know, one will be fine and the other will be, you know, sort of deteriorating or accelerating. And so, you know, you might want to sort of shift your focus to some extent. But I think what we have to acknowledge is that from a labor market perspective, right? Because it's clear that he has shifted, right? He's starting the process of shifting away from labor, which is what they have been focused on over the prior few meetings, which is why they've delivered 100 basis points of cuts at this point. But it's pretty clear that they're shifting back toward inflation now. I would caution against doing that too forcefully because what we know is that there are some cracks that are forming in the labor backdrop. Now, again, I would hasten to add. Just because I'm saying cracks does not mean that I think the floor is going to fall out from from beneath labor. In fact, I don't think that's going to be the case at all. I think labor will be fine. I mean, you know, the continued economic expansion is, is and has been our call over the coming and for the coming years. So, I, you know, I want to sort of level set for everyone on that. But that does not, you know, mean that we should take our eyes off the fact that quit rate is getting clobbered. The hiring rate is slowing down. Confidence toward labor has deteriorated, right? Per the conference board's labor differential. And that has a very good relationship with the unemployment rate, which is up what? Almost 100 basis points from from the nearby low. So, so, you know, these are these are realities. I mean, labor has slowed down demand at large has really slowed down. So I don't think we should take our eye and I don't think the fed should and I don't think that they will take their eye off of labor. I just think that shifting these focuses from like one mandate to the other, I think just lent itself to volatility, particularly as it relates to volatile economic reports, which is what we've been getting. One potential possibility of volatility here we haven't talked about just yet is the incoming Trump administration and how policy could affect the economic trajectory going forward. How do you factor that in? How does the Fed factor that in? Yeah, I think, I think Powell had it quite right when when he said, you know, they just they can't build it into their forecasts at at this point. And I have nothing but sympathy for that. The reality is we just don't know what these policies are actually going to be. So, for better or for worse, you know, the Fed is going to have to be reactionary. How do you expect the Fed to react that given how what kind of uncertainty we have for Trump administration policy? Carefully. I mean, I think that, you know, we have to recognize there are extremes from a tariff perspective and from an immigration perspective that could do some damage from from an economic perspective. If you get more modest versions of tariff and immigration policy, then it probably, you know, doesn't turn out to be nearly as bad, right? So, my view is that I think people are putting a little too much emphasis on the negative and I think they're putting a little too much emphasis on the positive. And I think ultimately if we get more modest versions of immigration and tariff policy, I think that our view that this is going to be, you know, sort of a roughly 2% year in 2025, I think we'll will remain firmly intact. Is a 2% inflation target still realistic for this Fed? I mean, I don't know if it was ever really totally realistic to, I mean, just sort of thinking over history. I mean, look, the central banks want an anchor and two percent is just the sort of the number that they landed on. So, in that context, I have sympathy for a target. Is this supposed to be 2.0 percent? That's a completely debatable point. I mean, there's nothing empirical that really drives home. That 2.0 percent is the right number. And if you think about, you know, where inflation spends most of its time, it's not at 2.0 percent. So, you know, look, should the Fed go to a range, sort of like the RBA, the Reserve Bank of Australia, like they do? I mean, I think that that is a reasonable discussion. But the Fed has been pretty clear that that's not going to be part of any debate that's happening internally and 2.0 percent is going to be the target for the foreseeable future. Where do you put Fed credibility right now, given that they kicked off the rate cut cycle so quickly, slowed down just a bit, now projecting so much fewer rate cuts into next year? Yeah, I mean, look, I've been speaking with a number of folks, you know, post the FOMC meeting. And I think a lot of them are sort of scratching their head, okay, you know, what exactly just happened? And not just at the FOMC meeting that just passed, but over the last few FOMC meetings. So, you know, is credibility being tarnished or dinged up here? No, I don't think that's the case. I think the Fed has really very much earned the credibility that they do have. But I do think people are wondering aloud about, you know, do they have it right? So, I wouldn't call it a crisis of confidence, not by a long shot, but I do think people are wondering if they have the right take on this. Really appreciate this, Tom. Thanks for coming on with us on the Christmas holiday. That's Tom Porceley with us here, Chief US Economist at PGM fixed income. And as we continue on the special holiday edition of Bloomberg Daybreak, we are going to bring you a special round table looking at stocks in 2025. We're going to speak with Lori Calvacina, head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, along with Cameron Dawson, Chief Investment Officer at New Edgewell. So, stay with us. It's 20 minutes past the hour. I'm Nathan Hager, and this is Bloomberg. Thanks for being here on this special edition of Bloomberg Daybreak. Markets are closed for the Christmas holiday. I'm Nathan Hager. We now turn from the economy in 2025 to the stock market. 2024 has certainly been a good year if you are a bull on Wall Street. Will it be even more happy returns in the new year? For that, we're pleased to welcome two of our favorite analysts on this market. Lori Calvacina, head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets and New Edge Chief Investment Officer at Cameron Dawson for a holiday stock round table. Thanks to both of you for being here. I mean, we've had a more than 20% gain, I think, for the S&P 500 year to date. I'll start with you, Lori. Can the market keep up that kind of momentum into 2025? All right. So thanks for having me, Nathan. And look, you know, I've got a 10% target on the market for 2025, at least where the market closed when we put our numbers out. So we've been looking for 6600. And we think that's going to be another solid year of gains in the US equity market. Probably a little bit slower than what we saw this year. And we do think that we're going to have, you know, what some of my colleagues term as pot holes, right? Some bouts of five to 10% type drawdown. So we don't necessarily think it's going to be a completely smooth ride, but at the end of the day, we think it continues moderation and inflation is going to help keep P.E. multiples elevated. And we think a solid earnings growth factor off and a solid economy aren't also going to help propel this market higher, but there may be, there may be some, you know, volatility here and there that we have to deal with. Cameron, we have seen a lot of analysts raise their price targets for the S&P 500, particularly after the election of President-elect Donald Trump. Where are you sitting at this point? Well, it does create an interesting scenario where we're now seeing that overall in the market, we have stretch positioning, stretch sentiment, stretch valuations, as well as pretty lofty growth expectations depending on where you're looking at earnings estimates. All of those things don't have to be a death knell for forward returns. They're usually not good timing tools, but it could be that we have to spend some time growing into those higher valuations, which leads us to expect two distinct scenarios for the market in 2025. We think we're either going to have a talking heads market, a road to nowhere kind of sideways chop that looks like 2015 or 2018, giving us time to grow into those high valuations, or we have a prince market where we think let's go crazy, let's party like it's 1999, and we actually have a bubble scenario where we have another strong year of returns driven by valuation expansion, but of course we know what comes on the other side of melt ups, which is typically meltdowns. So in either scenario, we think that we could have this increase in volatility, instead of that low volatility up into the right market that we've been in for the last two years. Love the 80s metaphors. Is this a 1980s moment for you, Laurie? Oh, look, I do agree that we're going to have more of that volatility, and I think one thing that makes things so challenging is just this idea of animal spirit being so strong post-election and taking us into the new year. And so on the one hand, we do think that those good vibes get us off to a good start. We heard a lot about companies in particular just seeing activity being frozen in the quarters and months ahead of the election. So we expect some of that to be unlocked, and to really give us some good vibes. And we've also seen consumer sentiment improve post-election, and that is something that's very normal after elections, including changing the regard. I do sort of sympathize with that possibility of the print market. I think that one of the things that's tough for forecasters in 2025 is that we all put out forecasters and we have to articulate a base case. But the bear case and the bull case, sort of the tails around that forecasters, it seems like those are higher probability on both sides of the equation, and those tails are just fatter in the new year. And so I think the idea of kind of 12-month visibility, I'm not entirely sure that we have it right now, to be honest. I think we do our best as forecasters, but we have to admit that things are going to be changing quite rapidly in the year ahead. They're going to be policy developments out of DC. And I think Cameron hit the nail on the head in terms of stretch sentiment and stretch valuation. And those things can last. It's very hard to predict exactly when they top out, but they do tend to invoke some pain on the other side. And I think that makes it very, very tricky to time everything next year. So if we have this kind of froth in the market right now, this lack of clarity, what do you need the C Cameron to bring more clarity? What are you going to be looking for in the next couple of months? For us, it all comes down to earning estimates. And if you look at what has been the key underpinning driver of the last two years of the bull market, has been that 12 month forward earnings estimates continue to rise. And we think in the next month, when we start the fourth quarter earnings season at the end of January, we're going to start putting some of these earnings estimates to the test. Because this is the first quarter that you have the expectation that the 493, those non-Nag 7 names, will really start picking up the slack and earnings growth and pulling their weight. The question is, is that a bar that's too high? What you have in the 493 going into next year is a big re-exceleration in earnings growth. And so we have to ask the question of 10 that part of the market truly deliver, or are we still having to fall back on this small subset of Mag 7 names that have been such a key underpinning of the overall earnings estimates? So we're watching that 12 month forward number on EPS estimates very closely because if that starts to flatten out, the market returns likely flattened out as well. We're speaking with Cameron Doss and the Chief Investment Officer at New Edge Wealth and Lori Calvacina, head of U.S. Equity Strategy at RBC Capital Markets. Lori, how do you view the earnings backdrop heading into 2025? What do you need to say? Well, look, I think Cameron raised some excellent points. And if I think about the earnings environment, I would say sort of three things have been coming up in my conversations. I am looking for 271 on F and T EPS next year. The consensus is about 275. So we're a little bit below, you know, kind of that bottom up consensus, but kind of putting that aside, you know, I would say three things is number one, if you look at this past year, 2024, there was an enormous amount of downward guidance that happened before reporting the season actually kicked off. So companies really tried to keep the bar very low. And I think that set them up very well for this year. So I'm very curious to see if companies try to pull that rabbit out of a hat again in 2025. So, you know, I'm not expecting, frankly, the tone to be all that great when that reporting season kicks off in late January. The second thing is I want to see what companies say about the dollar. We've seen an increase in the dollar year over year and that does tend to push earnings revisions down. We haven't really seen that yet. But it does tend to hit most sectors in the market aside from things like financials, reads, and utilities. So we're watching to see if we might get some true enough there. And then the last thing, you know, that I'm really focused on when we get that January reporting season starting up is what our company is saying about margins and costs. Bloomberg does a great job of the Bloomberg intelligence folks of tracking the bottom up self-side consensus estimates and what they're showing and their margin stats is that we've been seen 2025 operating margins for the S&P really coming down since the middle of 2024. And that's really coincided in my work with just increased concerns about cost and inflation. We really do think that we're going to need to see sort of what companies are saying about that cost environment because strong margins have really been keeping earnings forecast to loss. And if that story ends, I think it could be problematic for stock. It's really interesting to bring up those points about the dollar and about margins, the potential for higher costs. That raises the issue of what policy could mean for companies going forward in terms of Fed policy and fiscal policy at a Washington DC. How much does that affect how stocks could travel in 2025 for you, Cameron? Well, it's been very interesting over the last couple of years how resilient stocks have been to changes and expectations for Fed policy. If we contrast how we started 2024 with six cuts priced in, six and a half cuts actually into the beginning of the year. And at the end of the day, we only got four cuts in that we had a more hawkish Fed than expected. Stocks had this ability to shake that off. The question is, can they continue to do that if the Fed does not deliver on those cuts in 2025 that they're now projecting to be two cuts for next year? If we think about how that translates then into the dollar, if the Fed continues to be in this position where they're seen as more hawkish, more restrictive in their policy than the rest of the world, which is having to cut because their economies are weaker, the end result is that you have that continued upward pressure on the dollar, which of course is Lori pointed out, could mean challenges for company earnings that are relying on overseas revenues. So if we think then in the context of financial conditions, we still are in a place where financial conditions are very loose, very easy and considered to be supportive or even stimulative for growth. The question for 2025 is how that progresses if the Fed continues to remain relatively hawkish to the rest of the world, could we see financial conditions tighten and thus feed into risk asset prices? What's your view on that Lori? Do you think financial conditions are going to tighten and can companies continue to sort of look past some of the hawkishness starting to build up in the Fed? It's a great question Nathan and I'll call you, you know, after this last Fed meeting, you know, there were sort of two things that jumped into my mind based on sort of said conversations and said policy impact on data from the past year. And the first one was, if I think back to what I was reading from companies in our transcript reviews, and it really earlier on in the year, one of the big points of uncertainty that companies were struggling with was just the sort of uncertainty over the path of interest rates. And so to the extent that we're bringing some of that uncertainty back, I do worry a little bit that it could weigh on corporate confidence. The second thing is if I think about my own modeling for F&P earnings, I've been talking about this a lot in my meetings with investors lately, it's not that the debt burgues are in manageable, but I have, you know, one line item in my earnings model where we try to forecast interest expense relative to sales and it's based on a variety of macro indicators. And, you know, long story short, that part of my model always behaves very, very well. And the interest expense has tended to be pretty low. What I've noticed the last couple quarters is that the interest expense line item has been coming in a bit hotter than my forecast. And then I also, you know, recently took a look at the effect of interest rates that S&P 500 companies are paying on the debt they have outstanding. And that's moved up pretty meaningfully. So overall, I look at this as it just seems like it's getting a little bit harder for companies to manage other debt burdens from an interest rate perspective. And so I do wonder if maybe that could dampen corporate confidence just a little bit in the new year. And Cameron, what do you see is potentially the biggest headwind to the rally as we get into 25? I would certainly agree with Lori. The idea is that a lot of companies were banking on the Fed bailing them out in 2025. It was a survived to 2025 kind of mentality. Mostly within the small and mid cap line of things where we tend to see less profitable companies more reliance on short term debt and higher overall debt levels. And so if we think about the Fed staying tighter and interest rates staying higher, that would certainly create a challenge for companies that were expecting the exact opposite to happen. So that could effectively weigh on some of this hope and dream for a cyclical recovery because you're not getting the support from lower interest rates and just create an earnings headwind that is not contemplated in the market that's trading still at 22 times forward earnings. So it certainly would be a challenge and potentially something that would come right into terms of those high valuation. Stay with us. We're going to continue this conversation with Cameron Dawson of New Edge Wealth and RBC Capital Markets Lori Calvacina. See what areas of the markets you too like in 2025 as this special Christmas edition Bloomberg Daybreak continues. I'm Nathan Hager and this is Bloomberg. Join Capital Group CEO Mike Gitlin on the Capital Ideas podcast. Investment professionals reveal how they find their next great idea, what gives them their investment edge and a few personal stories. Subscribe or ever you get your podcasts. Capital client group ink. Let's talk about some areas of the stock market that you both like in 2025. How will we start with you Cameron? Well, we are looking more at value areas going into 2025. We're not buying value broadly. We think that there are a lot of low quality and value traps within the overall value style. But the degree of underperformance has been so pronounced versus growth that we think a lot of companies are just simply being ignored. If you look over the last two years growth or value has underperformed growth by over 60%, which just leaves room for more valuation kind of buffer for those lower lower price companies. So we're being selective. We're putting a quality overlay on that value side of things looking for good cash flow, good return on invested capital, but looking for names that are trading at a discount simply because they have been left behind over the last two years. It feels like growth has been the place to be though for quite a while, what's your view? Well, I would just say on growth versus value, you know, in our year ahead outlook, we gave value a tiny edge just because growth has been so crowded and so overvalued. But one of the things that has come up in conversations over the last few weeks has just been, there's not as much opportunity and value as there was six months ago. And growth has really been fighting back in terms of defending its earnings dominance. So I wouldn't completely give up on things like the MAX7. I would look for opportunities on the value side of the market, but I do think until we really see the earnings growth leadership seeded from growth to value, I think that growth is going to continue to fight back and you're going to see volatile trends. I will say in that context, one of my favorite sectors has a good mix of growth and value within it. And so our fresh money idea for 2025 at the sector level is communication services. It's cheap. It's got had positive earnings revision trends. There has not been a lot of talk about politics in this sector, which I frankly like just given how a number of things could go in multiple directions. And when I look at my industry work, there's pretty broad base appeal by industry within that sector. So that's really the one we're emphasizing, you know, on more of the value side, I see opportunity in smaller cap financials, especially regional banks and on more of the growth side areas we've been highlighting have been things like software and IT services, which still have pretty reasonable valuations and very strong earnings revision trends. It's going to be interesting to see which of any sectors can stay politically agnostic heading into 2025. But in terms of the sector level camera, what are you looking at? Well, we find opportunities across sectors and we're more focused on the quality factor quality style of investing, which is just to say that if we look over the last three months, there has been a big deterioration in the performance of quality names versus low quality high beta high momentum parts of the market. But what's interesting is that high beta high momentum low quality are all in the 99th percentile of outperformance. So we think that this is the time to not chase that part of the market, but instead look for those names as I mentioned earlier with good balance sheets with good free cash flow that simply have been left behind in the last few months of the low quality rally and using that as an opportunity to build into positions that we would consider crowned. And Laurie, I know you said that you wouldn't count growth out just yet, but can the Mag 7 continue the kind of momentum that we've seen over the last several months? It's a great question and I think one of the reasons why this rotation has gotten started, it hasn't really been smooth. But one thing you're seeing in the Mag 7 means is the celebration of earnings growth in terms of expectations that are embedded in the market and the individual companies for 2025. So whenever we see hot growth momentum areas with the accelerating earnings growth, you know, if I think back over the last couple decades in my career, it tends to make investors very skittish and it tends to make you know any sort of misstep really magnified in terms of negative price reaction. So I do think that that is a high hurdle. That being said, the value part of the market is just not stepping up and taking over leadership. And so when we look at 2025 earnings growth expectations, the Mag 7, you know, is it, I believe it's down in the single digits, but so it's sort of the rest of the market. And it's not, the rest of the market has not able to surpass that Mag 7 earnings growth. And when I look, you know, take a look at it slightly differently and I look at the relative PE between a basket of top 10 market cap names in the S&P and I compare that with the rest of the market. And then I do the same analysis on long-term earnings growth expectations. The relative PE is tracking the relative long-term earnings growth expectations. They're almost an identical chart. So Mag 7 is getting that superior valuation because the earnings growth expectations longer term are still vastly superior to the rest of the market. And until you see something change in terms of long-term earnings growth expectations, that could be Mag 7 falling apart, that could be rest of the market really surging. But until something changes, I think that you're going to be stuck in elevated relative valuations for that top 10, Mag 7 cohort. And they basically, the bottom line is they deserve the premium valuations that they're getting from an earnings perspective. Thanks for this, Lori. And great to have you with us on as well, Cameron Dawson. That's New Edge Wealth, Chief Investment Officer Cameron Dawson with us, along with Lori Calvacina, head of US Equity Strategy at RBC Capital Markets. And we're going to wrap up our daybreak Christmas special with a focus on the retailers this holiday season. Who better to do that with then? Bert Flickinger, Managing Director at Strategic Resource Group. Happy Holidays, Bert. I think it was a pretty happy holiday kickoff in terms of shopping season. So how do the retailers do? Good kickoff is, you said Nathan and as stable finish, suggested for inflation, November, December sales should be up about 1% given the two-thirds of American consumers just reported on the Bloomberg terminal or living paycheck to paycheck. Good results for retail overall. One percent sounds pretty tepid. What does that tell us about 2025? Concerns ahead in 2025, Nathan. We're already seeing it in the wipe out of chain drug, chain dollar, especially best-by consumer electronics. The only ones that are really winning Nathan is food and off price and the rest are struggling and poise as many consumers for thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah New Year's are buying by now. Pay for part of it now. Pay for the rest of it later. Does that tell you that we're going to see a downturn getting into 2025 if the consumer continues to be selective as it has been throughout 2024? Nathan, yes, to your question point, we're expecting a strategic resource group downturn. The XRT on the Bloomberg terminal, the S&P retail index is at an all-time high going into this last week of December. Walmart's pretty heavily valued. Target's probably undervalued with a Taylor Swift tailwind that will really help them the rest of this month and into the new year. But most of retail struggling, what's really a leading indicator on the terminal, Nathan, is that restaurant sales on a cash on cash basis were negative last month for the first time in about four years. So where do you see consumers concentrating their spending in 2025? Is it just going to be all about staples or is there room for some of those big ticket items to get a little bit of a look at least? Well, big ticket items, Nathan. Bloomberg's reported well since Black Friday is AAA is expecting record travel close to 110 million travelers most by car. But they're going to be spending on experiences. So 70% of the expenditures to your question is going to be on an experience is 30% on retail. Retail people say, well, they're great bargains between today, Christmas, and Hanukkah Day. In the new years, the smart shoppers a lot smart to stores and wait till calendar 2025 for desperation discounting as the retail ice age accelerates and more retailers contract or some even collapse into bankruptcy and have to look at more and more inventory. Wonder if that points to an opportunity for some retailers on an aspect that we've talked about in the past, providing more of an experience on the brick and mortar side. Is that something that's a possibility into next year? So does that point to an opportunity for retailers to provide more of an experience along the lines of an aspect of retail that we've talked about in the past? Nathan, you're raising a really important point about experiences and yes, they're doing it well in London, Dubai, Paris, Toronto, and throughout the Asia Pacific region. They're not doing it in the US and we're seeing sex with Avenue not investing in windows for the first time in their history. And we're seeing the ones who have experiences are winning specifically target wall-to-wall Taylor Swift's Eris tour release of her book, her music, her licensed merchandising, Big Wind for Target, Kruger company, always a big partner of Disney, Big Winter, experientially, wall-to-wall from Disney to societal good for people from all walks of life, especially for people who are nutritionally and economically challenged. So Wind for Kruger, Wind for Target, not a win for the rest of retail in terms of experiential, which is so important this time of year. How do you see retailers making that kind of investment in an experience? Do they have the wherewithal to do it? Nathan, ironically, or idiosyncratically, it's an investment, as you said, rather than an expense. It's almost analogous to retail crime. The Kruger company in Costco and Target invest in crime prevention for shopper, worker, and vendor security the same way they invest in experiences to really excite and delight shoppers of all ages where Walmart treats everything as an expense. And one of the things in the attachments we sent for another day and another time is Walmart fails worldwide where they don't get subsidies. And in the US taxpayers subsidized Walmart, Target, Amazon, Aldi, and Costco with the expensive retailers that pay their own way like Kruger, CBS, etc. So the retailers that are subsidized do not invest in experiences and oftentimes do not invest in security, which is the ultimate consumer and commercial irony across America. It sounds like a challenging backdrop heading into 2025 for retail. Thank you for this Bert. Really appreciate it.
