Inside from the reporters and editors that bring you America's most trusted business magazine. Plus, global business, finance and tech news. The Bloomberg Business Week podcast with Carol Masser and Tim Stenevich on Bloomberg Radio. I want to bring in Bloomberg News Otter reporter Keith Norton for more on this and then some other Tesla news that we learned a little earlier. Today that Tesla's annual vehicle sales dropped for the first time in more than a decade despite a year and push that sent deliveries to a record in the fourth quarter. Tesla shares selling off as a result. We're going to get to that in just a minute, Keith. But I do want to start with the news just moments ago that we learned from officials in Las Vegas that members of Tesla staff are on their way to Las Vegas to assist. Law enforcement agents with finding information from this cyber truck that yesterday had an explosive device or explosive devices in it. I'm curious what types of information they can get from what happens inside of Tesla what happens outside of Tesla. Because for people who aren't familiar with these vehicles, these have quite a few cameras recording at all times on the outside. For sure. So modern vehicles, particularly Teslas, are highly sophisticated. They have a lot of devices that record what goes on in the car. Cameras being one of them. And so while they're not for level of a black box on a jet or something like that, it can provide a lot of important information if you're doing an investigation like this. You know, we have two incidents yesterday, the one in Vegas with the Tesla cyber truck and then the attack in New Orleans on Bourbon Street. And that was with a Ford F-150 lightning. I've been on the phone with Ford this morning and they are also cooperating with authorities to provide them any information they can glean from that F-150 lightning. So the way modern cars, particularly electric vehicles, these are both electric vehicles, both rented from TURL by the way. And so they can provide all sorts of interesting and helpful data as this investigation goes on. I got to ask you, Keith. Okay. And again, forgive us folks because we're trying to be very careful here and really just talk about facts and stuff. But is it interesting that both were electric vehicles? Yeah. Well, I mean, one way to look at that. And again, I don't want to go too far into the speculation. But electric vehicles, in the case of the New Orleans attack, they are powered by a battery that is very heavy, that adds thousands of pounds of weight to the vehicle. So, you know, if you're looking to maximize destructive properties, more weight will do that. Keith, what do you make of the TURL connection here? I think a lot of folks might be familiar with traditional places to rent a vehicle, but are now hearing about TURL for the first time. Right. And TURL, you know, it can be a little bit like automotive Airbnb. Sometimes it's individuals who are renting out their exotic cars. TURL has been known for exotics and for electric vehicles. We don't know, or I don't know the details of how these two were rented and where they come from. I know that in the case of Ford, from my conversations with them, they're trying to help with that. But it is a rental, traditionally, that has rented more exotic cars, different cars, electric vehicles, not your standard, you know, hurts and atas. All right. We're going to move along. And obviously we're going to continue to monitor any headlines that might come out on either situation in New Orleans or in Vegas. Keith, we initially thought we were going to talk to you about Tesla's sales numbers, which we'd given everybody a heads up on New Year's Eve that we expected there to be some disappointment. I am curious though. Tesla shares are selling off our investors right to be disappointed. Is it a big deal for Tesla? It is a big deal because it's the first decline in annual sales in more than a decade. And to put it in context, when that last drop happened between 2010 and 2011, Tesla was selling about 1200 vehicles a year back then. It's now selling close to 2 million. So it's a completely different situation. And you know, every once in a while the market is reminded that yes, Tesla is a car company. And if they don't sell enough cars, they don't make enough money. This stock has been on a tear, particularly since the election because everyone is excited about the political influence that Elon Musk would have. It's been also rising since Elon Musk has focused so much more on AI and the robot actually they're developing. But when it comes down to it, Tesla need to sell electric vehicles and they're having a harder time doing that. Is Tesla having the same issues that other EV companies are having competition from China less of an interest in EVs and more of an interest in hybrids high ticket prices that many Americans and people around the world can't necessarily afford, especially when you compare it with those Chinese EVs and then cars from with the traditional internal combustion engines. Is that what the issue is? Absolutely. Tesla is facing those same headwinds as the rest of the industry, but Tesla has an additional headwind and that is the rest of the industry. You know, they basically had the EV market to themselves until a few years ago. And particularly in this past year, we now have I think 75 EVs on the US market. So you have GM coming finally with their EVs and their lower price where Tesla doesn't have much product to play with. But Tesla really needs to get its volumes back up. Is this model Y refresh known as Juniper this coming next year that's supposed to be in the mid 30,000 range right now. So Tesla's average prices are above 40,000 and they've come down a lot because Tesla is resorted to the old fashioned marketing incentives that normal car makers do like 0% financing and free charging. So they've done that and their prices have come down a bit, but they're still a little high for mainstream buyers. So Tesla getting to the point, we often talk about a tech company that's an upstart on a growth trajectory, kind of owns its market and then it matures a little bit. Is that kind of what's happening in Keith? I mean, can we kind of put that label on Tesla or not necessarily? Definitely from its traditional EV selling business. It has matured at the very time that as we said, the EV market is slowing. So, you know, it's just a harder sell with EVs right now on the growth rate of EVs last year was in the mid 7%. You know, the year before was 47%. So we're in a very cooling market for pure electric vehicles and that's all Tesla sells and Tesla's lineup is really aging. So they desperately need new and refreshed product to reinvigorate their sales. All right, can't leave it on that note. Keith Norton, thank you so much.

Listen on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business app or watch us live on YouTube. All right, let's get now to someone who's got to make investment bets. And he recently wrote about the parallel between the dot com bubble and today's AI driven euphoria. He says we are in the late stages of a major financial euphoria episode. We welcome back Bill Smead, CIO over its Smead Capital Management. They've got approximately $7.5 billion in assets under management. Bill joining us on this Thursday. It is Thursday. It's a new year joining us from Phoenix, Arizona. Bill, good to have you back with us. Happy new year. I don't know. Tell us about this parallel between the dot com bubble and the AI. We've talked about this actually a fair amount here at Bloomberg. Does it burst then at some point and how do you tell or any indication of when that happens? Well, I listened to your prior segment. This won't be a black swan. This will be an in your face duck. In other words, it is absolutely inevitable. Here's what I love about the current euphoria. All the other euphoria is front loaded the stock prices of the beneficiaries of the new legitimate business development. In 2009, it was front loading the excitement about radio and RCA was the Nvidia. In 6970, it was landing on the moon in the semiconductor and ultimately peaked out with the Nifty 50. In 99, it was the internet was going to change our life. Did they succeed? Did all those legitimate developments play out and get used dramatically more and completely changed the way Americans operated? The answer is yes. Did people get crushed in the stock market in all prior cases? The answer is yes. If you owned the momentum trades of the last three or four years, whether it be a year from now or a month from now or three weeks ago, the pain that people are going to get exhibited on them versus the trade off of an additional year of glorious success. Like the last two years will be it's a bad risk reward relationship. It's right in front of everyone's face. It's not a black swan. It's not hidden anywhere and your friend and London made the right call. We've got 15 different indicators, not just the option trading. Unfortunately, every measurement tool for measuring historical stock market valuation is at the absolute 98% tile or higher right now. So then if we agree with you, then what happens? How much of a market decline? How much has to be taken off? What kind of froth needs to be taken off in your view to make it more normalized? I think you go to 73, 74. And the problem is 73, 74 was a 50% decline in the S&P over two years and then didn't come out of it until 1982. The Dow used to be the primary benchmark at that time and the Dow kept peaking out at 1,000 including in 1972. And then we started from 775 on the Dow at the bottom in August of 1982. We'll leave a couple of minutes, but I want to ask you though, isn't it safe to say that today's marketplace maybe not the same as 70 or what was going on in the 70s? And maybe I just think about the frequency with how information kind of flies through the market and social media and the velocity and when things don't look right, they kind of get taken down pretty quickly. Yeah, it's different this time, I think is what you're asking. It is different. It's always different this time. It's always different, but the similarities is what kill you. So I haven't read a piece this last week from 2014, from Warren Buffett. And this is 2014. He said, you know, the market spends most of its time reasonably priced and he calls that reasonableness. But in 2014, he said in his career, five times it lost its reasonableness. And that was in 2014. So I think when his partner Charlie Munder said, this is the biggest financial you've 40 episodes his career because of the totality of a few years ago, I think Buffett is demonstrating through raising cash that he thinks this market lacks reasonableness. So we have 30 seconds left. Where are the opportunities for this year? The opportunities are spelled E and E R G Y. You already heard that from you before. 40% of electricity is made with natural gas. I'm not a commodity trader, but that's what I'd be all over. I'm oil and gas stocks. The price of oil is not going to go down by the way, pertaining to your prior conversation, people that live in China, their body temperature is 98.6. It's the oldest civilization in the world. And they're very intelligent people. The chance of them pulling themselves out of this is 100% and American exceptionalism is way overcooked because we're just 98.6 and that's all we're ever going to be. All right, going to have to leave it on that note. Thank you so much. We know we had a lot of breaking news and we had to jump around a little bit, but Bill Smith, we really appreciate getting some time with you. Bill Smith, Chief Investment Officer, it's Meet Capital Management coming to us from Phoenix, Arizona. Not everybody likes talking about money. Some people find it awkward. Sometimes even find it a little embarrassing. I do not. I like talking about money. Whether it's the boardroom, the newsroom, the trading floor. I've spent the last 30 years talking about money, writing about money and talking about it and writing about it a little bit more. I'm Erin Somsetworth and every week Senior Aborted John Sturper and I answer your questions about personal finance and we discuss the best strategies for making the most of your money. Listen in to the kind of insights and explanations everyone can use to help them make better saving and investment choices for themselves and their families. My question is whether you think maxing out my compy pension match is enough for when it comes to saving for my pension. Should I attempt to pay my child's university fees and living costs? My partner and I have access savings so should we overpay on our mortgage or should we put the money into stocks? From Bloomberg Podcasts, June into Merrin Tooks Money, for the Merrin Tooks Money on Apple Podcasts, but if I were ever you listen. You're listening to the Bloomberg Business Week Podcast. Catch us live weekday afternoons from 2-5 Eastern. Listen on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business app or watch us live on YouTube. This is not going to surprise anyone who has listened to or watched our show in the past because we talk about this a lot but women founded startups get only a fraction of the VC funding of mail startups. I mean we're talking single digits here. I mean depending on- Depending on which data you look at, you know, pitch book or others it's like single digits. Yeah. But they made gains last year. Women in non-binary VC investors have gained a foothold in the tech industry. Five years faster than the advocacy group all raised expected but leaders say a national backlash to diversity, equality and inclusion initiatives threatens the progress that's been made. So Carol about 18% of decision makers at US VC firms are female. It's double from 2018 when all raise was founded and set a goal of reaching that number by 2028. That's according to the groups and your report that was published last year. So some progress. Some progress. Yeah. Some progress. Let's see what Jesse Draper has to say about that. She's founding partner of halogen ventures. The VC firm has invested more than 75 female founded tech startups including baby list flex, Everly Well and more. She joins us on this Thursday from Los Angeles. Jesse good to be talking again with you. It does feel like first of all that there is a backlash on all things DEI. How is that potentially going to impact the VC world, which already when it comes to female founded firms. I mean, man, they have to struggle to find funding. They do have to struggle to find funding, but you know, the best companies will get funded. I think the most important thing right now that we think about is just getting capital into the hands of women. And that could be a female in the founding team like at halogen ventures when we invest, there has to be a female in the founding team. And we were still part of one of the largest raises of 2024, which was a $1.9 billion raise with a female in the founding team. And it's called metropolis. It's a parking technology company. You know, there's no lack of incredible deals being started by women. I think it's about looking at the world a little differently, getting into new networks and breaking out of like our traditional way of deploying capital. Also, thank you for having me again, Carol and Tim. It's good to be here. You're welcome. You're welcome. You know, I was just looking at Tim and I'm just saying, listen, part of the reason it's fun to do a show, man, woman, whatever, like some diversity. Like we do look at things differently, Tim. And I do think about what's being lost in the VC world by not looking at female founded firms who look at the world differently and maybe what's needed. Well, Jesse, talk a little bit about networks because this is something you absolutely understand being in the space and essentially growing up in the space. What are networks when it comes to venture capital? Pull the curtain back a little bit. I look at it as networks and tech ecosystems. So when I think about networks, you know, I think women lack those networks. Traditionally, men have won past the pocketbooks down from generation to generation and we need to like break the women in there right now is the largest transference of generational wealth and the majority of that's actually going to be going to women. So we need women investing and we need capital going to women, which hopefully will inevitably happen. We are, you know, I think about networks and you would start with say Stanford where Silicon Valley is where I literally grew up. I've lived in LA for 20 years, but, you know, Stanford started the first sort of technology ecosystem as we know it. And these typically begin with a university. And so you build that out because then great talent comes from the university. And ultimately great companies spin out of that university. So, you know, you look at the great tech ecosystems across the country. Those networks are starting to broaden because we're now seeing many more than just 12 technology cities across the country. We at halogen ventures actually just announced that we were the first out of state investment that innovate Alabama made into a fund. And so we've partnered with innovate Alabama. And we have been going and researching and digging in and meeting with hundreds of entrepreneurs in Alabama. And I have to say, even I was surprised by I hadn't spent a ton of time in Alabama. I don't know that a lot of people in California have I shouldn't generalize generalize there, but there are some amazing tech ecosystems there. There's world class universities over 40 50 fortune 500 companies represented to are actually base there. A lot of great aerospace, ag tech, you know, and I'm I'm blown away by the incredible talent in Alabama. And I think we just need to start looking at new tech ecosystems starting with new universities in different locations. There's a lot going on in the south and we're really trying to capitalize on that. I think also as a strategy, we're really thinking how do we get out of those typical networks where people are only investing in the Stanford's and the Harvard's of the world. Which, you know, we have Stanford's and Harvard's in our portfolio as well. But I think it's important to create a well diversified portfolio. And if you look at ecosystems around the world, even in like sub-Saharan Africa, they often give capital to the women to build the community and build the ecosystem and build the world for family. Right. Right. Go back to the world. I'm just Muhammad Eunice, right? And the growing problem. No, you think about micro micro, you know, investing micro lending in particular. It was to the woman because she would put the money to work. And sometimes it was making baskets or doing something that seems so basic, but it created income for that family. And she paid back the loan. And it created a better life for that family. I want to go back though to what you're saying about working with Alabama and some other universities. It reminds me of Steve Case, you know, the AOL co founder and. Rise of the rest. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Rise of the rest. Yeah. And the future of technology being outside Silicon Valley. Talk to us a little bit about your portfolio. And what you're, you know, in a world where we spend so much time talking about artificial intelligence and generative AI and super high tech things going on and autonomous driving and robots. What is it that you know, where you are putting your VC money at this point? Yeah. Thank you for asking that. You know, so we are, we have over 75 companies now and five of those are current unicorns. We're still young in the space, but we're doing fantastic. I'm really proud of our portfolio. And we're excited about investing in Alabama because Alabama is actually unfortunately listed as 50th and quite a few things. Education among them, but most pertinent to halogen. It is ranked 50th for female founders. And so we really wanted to make change there and innovate. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And so we're really proud of our family. And everybody in Mexico,���ian, old people, they've had an interactive live art community. And so I have been with in a gathering of help, I've been with in a couple of other SFEncircuit placements. And so they've been, I've been with in a gathering of help, I've been with in a phi la popltry,好好 providers online in social media where they're here to help with their children participate in education. And so we're mistaking their big careers in those sports, some of these talented ogre that are typically a population that we're off of and those characters really work together but we're also protecting it and we're protecting it, we're protecting it. on affordable childcare, on healthcare for families, on financial management tools, which was sort of an interesting piece of our data that we found that families were looking for, like how do we manage our money? So we're investors in Sally Crotchx Company, LVES, the first financial management platform to take childcare into account. But upwards, which I was mentioning, they're actually solving that problem of unaffordable childcare, because 99% of society can't afford a, you know, private preschool or preschool just in general. And upwards, it's finding these locations, vetting them, and now has 66,000, many in Alabama, all across the country. And they have corporate benefits programs. They have, they signed an eight-figure deal with the government to subsidize costs for those living below the poverty line. And so we're really trying to solve those issues in society that I think people have forgotten about, you know, we're in this company, Binti, and really, it was like people are still two-day matching children with homes, both foster and adoptive by hand. The founder was meeting with these families, and then meeting with these social service agents, who'd have stacks of papers and say, here's my family cases, you know, here's the kids looking for families, and it's completely inefficient. So they created some great technology. They now match the families, find the families, build the families, and they're just listening to what these families need, and they're doing incredibly well. So there's a huge opportunity, and I know we're also making an impact, but, you know, I am looking to, obviously, capitalize on this opportunity, be wow, making an impact. And I think that's what people think, oh, investing in women is charity, investing in childcare, people were telling me, wasn't a big enough opportunity, even though it affects so much of society. Right. I, you know, I said, okay, well, I'll take that as a little challenge, and we'll show you how massive this opportunity is, and it's a $7.5 trillion opportunity. Jesse, just to really recap, just gotta be quick though, please, 20 seconds, 25 seconds. The incoming administration, new administration, is that gonna impact your world? Are you anticipating that just quickly? I think it is already impacting my world, you know, they're doing away with a lot of DEI. Opportunities for companies, I think I just really would encourage the business ecosystem, technology ecosystem, to invest your dollars, make sure that they are supporting women and diversity in general at the company stages, especially at the earliest stages. It is affecting us, so make sure we're breaking out of those traditional dude networks. And I love dudes just like everybody else, I've seen little boys, but just break out of those networks, we figure you're pulling a woman in the boardroom. Totally, yeah, totally get it. Listen, Happy New Yorker to check in with you. Of course, that is Jesse Draper of Halogen Ventures. Not everybody likes talking about money. Some people find it awkward. Sometimes they find it a little embarrassing.

From Bloomberg podcasts, June and to Merrin Talks Money, follow Merrin Talks Money on Apple Podcasts, or divide or wherever you listen. I'm probably my call. Yeah, but you let me drive. Oh, no, no, no, no. This is not a twenth. Who's going to drive you home? Honey, please, I'll do the drive. Drive on. Excuse me, I want to drive. You drive, you drive, you drive, you drive. That's the question that drives us. This is the drive to the close. That's fun to me. Take a closer, I wrote, John and Don on Bloomberg Radio. All right, TikTok everybody. Just about 18 minutes to go until we wrap up the first trading day of 2025. Definitely off our best levels at the session. What felt like a little bit of maybe a rally a different tree based on the last four days of 2024 as kind of an out of steam here Tim. Yeah, it has taken a look at the major equity indices. We did see higher to start the day. We're off our worst levels of the session. Still down three tenths of 1% pretty much across the board. All right, let's see what our drive to the close guest has to say. Back with us, it's been a while Vince, Catalano, Chief Marcus Dragis over at Stuyvesson Capital Management joining us here in our Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. Happy New Year. How are you? Well, I'm well, happy to get to both of you. Thank you. Yeah, I think it's good to have you here. I mean, we have talked with you over the years, different market cycles. How are you thinking about 2025? And what will be really kind of the big catalysts of the year? Is it as we talked earlier with our own Sam Potter and Chinelli Balsic? Is it all about the upcoming new Trump administration and what kind of policies we get? Well, if you listen to Jason Furman, which I reached out to or Ian Bremmer, where he's out to also, they would say, yeah, it would be economics, the Trump administration, terrorists, what does it mean? What are the consequences, et cetera? Now, if you on the other hand, we talked to someone that I call nostril domis, because he tries to sniff out the future, as opposed to nostril domis, and that being Sam Stovall. He will tell you that right now today is not a particularly positive sign from a market historical perspective. Why is today not a positive sign? Because when you make a lower low in January, lower than you did at the low point in December, then many more times than not, the year ahead turns out to be a negative year. Are you speaking like a market technician or like a CFA? No, not the CFA talk, just wondering. But it's only the first day of January. I'm sorry? It's only the first day of January. That's right. But if you go strictly by what he says, historical information says that when you make a lower low, in the first quarter, and it just happens to be that today's, the first day of the first quarter, well, then you end up with a period where the probabilities are. So it doesn't matter when it happens. It doesn't matter when it happens. Even if we get a rally in the next two or three weeks, your point is that we made this low today. You made the lower low today, and the probabilities are that you're going to have a down year for the year. Certainly, if you have an up year, the year is going to be modest. So that's the historical information. Now, when you add to that, certain other market technical issues that you reference to him, then, yeah, you've got some aspects there that are problematic and concerning. And then when you add to that, the other historical aspect, which is the business of two years up in a row of 20% gains, you generally don't get a third year. And the only time that happened when you have the third year, OK, was during, I believe, was the Clinton administration and was a presidential election year, which this is not. So is the message be cautious this year? What's the message that you have? I would say the thing to do, in addition to know yourself and the plans and make sure the risk tolerance et cetera are correct, is to have a more cautious approach at the beginning of the year. Make sure that you're investing on a long-term basis, for whatever your parameters are within your risk parameters, et cetera, OK? But also be aware of the fact that you're not a salmon, because it's swimming upstream. So it can be a bit of an issue this year. And I'd be looking to maybe rotate to different areas where you might be a little bit more cautious. So a fundamental trade or historical trade? Historical trade is part of it. Then you have also the market technical aspect of it from a momentum point of view, which is positive long-term, negative near-term, and a positive long-term contain negative in a short period of time. So you've got that weighing against the market. So it's not one thing. It's not one factor. But the historical element, first year of a president's term, et cetera, all of those things. When you put that role into the mix and a stretched market valuation that we have, it's hard to make a really compelling bullish case. Vity, one of the things we've been calling out in a big way on this first trading day of 2025 is earnings coming up, right? A couple of weeks away, we get JP Morgan. And then we'll be into another earnings season. If fundamentally those companies come out and they do well, top and bottom line, they're upbeat about the outlook, does that change things? The only way that we change is if you believe that price earnings ratio is really, really, really matter. And I'm not one that thinks it does. Because PE ratios are like a rubber band. Valuations like a rubber band, and it can stretch and stretch and stretch, John Maynard Keynes, Luggets for Remain, Irrational, Long-and-En, you can remain solving. So I look at fundamentals as a reference point. I look at fundamentals as the narrative that ties into the strategy that you want to employ. So I look at it, it's kind of a bit of a different approach. I'm looking at it from the fundamentals, and what does it mean to the narrative? Because this is investing a beauty contest. So that's what I think. So that what anybody thinks is what the market thinks. And if the market thinks based on, so indicators that you're looking at, and valuations not going to help you in this regard, then you'd have to say that it's concerning. So our stock's expensive right now? Oh, yeah. I think by pretty much most measures, see a face stuff. Yeah. There they are. PE ratios are stretched. Should we care, though? Yeah. Well, yes, you should care. Because ultimately, earnings are going to matter. And so, and the quality of earnings is going to matter. That's another dynamic. And when we talk about earnings, you mentioned, OK, good earnings come out, but what about the quality of them? And then you've got to be looking down the road. You've got to be looking, you know, six months, nine months down the road. And if you're a long-term investor, you basically kind of ignore a lot of this stuff and find the ones that you might be most interested in. Like, for example, if you believe that the energy demand is going to be really strong, then if you have a down market for a period of time, that presents a terrific opportunity for you to position yourself in the areas that you want to be. Back to the Trump administration. I mean, if we have tax cuts, if we have, I don't know, easier regulations, I'm just thinking about things that could give kind of some juice to the liquidity equation and then give some more momentum to the markets. Is that expected or at that, even that to what you're saying, if you cross it with fundamentals or technicals, it still isn't going to matter. You know when it comes down to Carol, it's no one thing. It never is. Yeah. It's going to be a massive down to like a PE ratio where things that that's what it isn't. It's multiple things and multiple levels and many different things. And multiple things at this point are against any kind of momentum continuing. Because that's kind of your problem. That's correct. When you end up the historical aspect, when you take a look at stretch earnings, when you look at the momentum grinding down market action, you know, price over PE ratios, things of that sort, excuse me, price over moving averages, that when you take all of those things into consideration, you know, you've got to lean more towards a cautionary approach that things are. So cash? I'm sorry. Matress? Well cash is not a bad place. Exactly. Or treasury is at this point, right? Well, yeah, treasury is except for the fact that, you know, I know one individual that I recommend to him that he continued to do his laddering approach, you know, three months, six months, nine months a year, to that kind of thing and scale it out there. All right, can I leave it there? Happy New Year. Nice to see you. Happy New Year to you.
