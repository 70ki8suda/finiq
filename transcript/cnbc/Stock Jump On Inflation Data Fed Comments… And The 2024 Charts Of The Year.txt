This is fast money Here's what's on tap tonight a massive market turnaround after one federal signals They're still maybe more rate cuts in the New Year Well digging on the comments. It seemed to get markets back in rally mode and losing weight Here's of nobun order to getting skinnier after its next-gen obesity drug draws disappointing results Meanwhile, Eli Lilly's that found just getting approval to treat sleep apnea So is Lilly now the unparalleled winner in the space plus American Express charges higher FedEx's post earnings rally gets poiled and the traders lay out their charts Of the year as we head into the last few trading days of 2024 I'm Melissa Lee come to you. Lock the studio be at the Nasdaq on the desk tonight Tim Seymour carrying with vitamin C Brasso and Mike Co We start off at the Fed comments and health the markets turn around today Stocks rebounding sharply after early losses after Chicago Fed president Austin ghouls be told or Steve Leesman He was encouraged by this morning's inflation data the Dow up nearly 500 points while the S&P and Nasdaq were each up a percent Sox did end off their highs of the session though in offering major indices were still down for the week for more on ghouls Bees comments. Let's turn to Steve Leesman Five days before Christmas and the Fed delivered to markets two dovish Fed officials and a friendly PCE Chicago Fed president Austin ghouls be telling CNBC and an exclusive interview that the funds rate is still substantially higher than the nutrient So there's room for the Fed to cut that's why I say over the next 12 to 18 months If conditions keep on the way that they have over the last 18 months I think rates come down a fair bit more rules be will vote on policy next year The Fed's preferred inflation indicator the PCE came out attempt better than expectations in New York Fed president John Williams In another exclusive interview like what he saw We've seen really sizable Movement down in inflation in the last couple of years. We're still not to our two percent goal We're going to make sure we get there, but definitely seeing good seen for the progress towards that goal Williams agreed with ghouls be that the Fed is above neutral so there is room to reduce rates After the lump of coal delivered by the Fed on Wednesday to markets the data and the Fed speak today We're welcome gift to investors on the weekend just before Christmas back to you guys All right, Steve Leesman. Thank you. So did ghouls be quell fears of a rate hike Next year because that was sort of entering the conversation torsance lock over at Apollo mentioned that in a research report on Wednesday But the data today plus ghouls be comments is that sort of take that off the table in your view for a little while Right until we get data that right exactly. I mean that so when I looked early this morning The handles were maybe down 50 or so and then after that PCE number came in Cooler that was down about 24 and I don't know what the rest of it was as the data Went on maybe those interviews that could definitely be it because those were very bullish But I think also some progress on the debt ceiling that helped as well and as well as the magnitude of yesterday Just kind of that sell off was getting a little bit sloppy. So I feel a little bit better. It's nice to see that CPE number come or PCE never come in a little bit better But I still think the trend is toward inflation and not a lot of a lot of cuts right yeah I look if you the numbers speak bear out what the market really how they Reactive to the PCE you went from you basically rallied almost 260 basis points from 950 AM until the markets then peaked up And then and then we can just small off to the end of the day But that translated into a major reversal over where we saw futures You know you you looked at your screens in the morning before the markets open you said wow This is kind of sloppy and we're probably going to go into the weekend and people are now reassessing their view of the Fed But I can't I think you're right. I mean sloppy in terms of how yesterday traded or how the couple days have traded really since those those Those power comments. I think that has as much to do with anything. I think markets are jittery You look at the five day on the S&P. It's it's you know we're down 3% I mean it's been even with this move today It's been a rough period after such an extraordinary period for equities where the the assumption was that inflation was your friend We had a number of other prints Going into the Fed meeting that that had you believe that wealth inflation isn't out of the picture And disinflation is certainly a thing of yesterday that the Fed is not going to be hiking having said that That is the biggest risk for 2025 at this point and it's not that the Fed will hike is that the perception of the Fed will change Yeah, I agree with that. I think the important thing is they're not going to be hiking So whether they're cutting by you know twice or four times Not really the issue the issue is do they hike but Powell the day of the meeting said that rates are meaningfully Restrictive right so he agrees with Gulsby he agrees with Williams I think that and he also doesn't want unemployment to tick up So you do have the power put I think that's the way I saw it I thought the markets totally overreacted to the commentary I get it he was a lot more hawkish than the market wanted him to be I don't think the narrative has changed Economy does worse He's there he'll cut more aggressively and he's got plenty of tools or plenty of time and plenty of plenty of basis points to actually cut I think the market got it wrong but the market always overreacts I mean there is still the sort of the conundrum the the You know squaring the circle that needs to be done between raising your inflation forecast and taking down the number of rate cuts And that's still even with the Gulsby comments Mike that puzzle still remains Yeah, I think I think that's definitely true I think what Karen was probably also referring to is that you know a lot of the secular pressures that are inflationary It's not like those things are are just simply going to go away We are at relatively full employment. So of course, you know Labor costs or something that we still obviously have to keep an eye on I mean to me though I think the important thing just in terms of what Tim was saying which is that the market is clearly jittery that bad news Was really greeted with a very severe knee jerk reaction I mean dropping 300 basis points in the S&P over the course of two hours sort of speaks to the fact that people might be a little concerned About the valuations you know one other point I would add and I don't think that's as true this week But going into next week and that is that we are you know Gonna have a little bit less liquidity I mean they're gonna be people who are not looking at their screens For all of next week and you know that can also create a little bit more of that kind of jump risk that we saw in prices this week Yeah, the liquidity get trained away and also there's the seasonality seasonality typically happens in the second half of December Here we are entering the the Santa Claus rally period oh ho ho ho and and I do think it's been quite Quite joyous at to this point and if you look at where markets really haven't had a chance to test the 50 That's what the S&P did hasn't tested the 50 really going all the way back to September and I remember this since that last September fed meeting Where yes rates kind of then started rising but markets also rose and if you look at the Nasdaq Nasdaq was up almost 14% From that fed set set 17 meeting into this last fed meeting so I think a lot of this is just a function of where we've come from It's been it's been a really joyous holiday period and again since Thanksgiving and and the economic data Let's not forget has been forget inflation that the data around retail sales the data around the labor market even there are people We've had them come on our show talk about they even think that the ISM manufacturing is doing a bottoming thing after a couple years of what we know has been recessionary Manufacturing activity so the economy's in really solid shape right now the market performed like that So yeah, I mean it's kind of to me nice to see the reactions to the Fed almost like they used to be In other words where you didn't know what the Fed was thinking remember when the Fed was more opaque and less transparent And it really felt like those were days where you truly got the chat chat or charity with no clarity You mean like green spam I mean I realize some of us were alive then and And it definitely seems like a long time ago and the days of irrational and jubberance But there there was a time where the Fed wasn't supposed to you know tell tale and essentially as signal every Yes, yes, the briefcase indicator wow was was thick thin. What was the issue? I forgot what yeah, but that was There were a lot more into transparent nobody carries briefcase anymore That's true. Have a briefcase Steve Not with me today So to Tim's point the 50 day moving averages right where the S&P close But more importantly we haven't even tested the 20 day moving average which is a momentum indicator no one looks at that It's around 6,000 So we hadn't been below that for a lot of time Everyone is now all of a sudden Maybe to Tim's point getting jittery, but I think You would probably say the market should come in three to five percent It did come in that three percent You could even make the case that the market should come in a little more from here And you'd still feel good about it. Yeah, I mean Julie in a manual I think was saying the market to come in at 13% or something in the first month or so of the year How do you feel? I mean you're gonna be one of the people who are not gonna you're not gonna be looking at your screen for the next Few days I'm not gonna do my yeah, yeah, um, I don't know I'm sort of looking forward where we get to talk about earnings again, which really won't happen till January 15th That's a little bit of a vacuum of not a lot of information, but um I don't know. I feel like we got a lot of unknowns. They're we're gonna see Assuming they get a deal tonight, which I think they will and even if it drags it tomorrow I don't think that really makes a difference. We'll see what's at the top of the Trump agenda coming in That'll be really important. I don't know if they'll start with if I were to air probably wouldn't start with the tariffs right away Probably start with something else, but who knows who knows Let me tell you one thing we didn't mention it though bitcoin Powell did not have to come out with that line that the federal reserve Doesn't have the permission to buy bitcoin and they're not looking to change that The market read that is extremely bearish Over on bitcoin because you have a federal reserve that their opinion shouldn't even matter It's treasuries opinion should matter, but that's where you start to see bitcoin cascade lower as well Yeah, uh Tim. What will you be doing next week besides uh, you know Decking the whole yeah, there's still some there's still some more minutes to go on the tree And there will be some running around this weekend, but but next weekend I think there's an opportunity first of all even after the the volatility of the last couple days I think there's still a lot of upside momentum and stocks that I think are the biggest companies in the world I think there's an opportunity to sell volatility I think actually three and six month vol and some of the biggest companies in the world that have run really hard into this I think it's an opportunity because I think it also gives you an opportunity to you know trade around a little bit that in that first quarter of the year Where I think we will get some volatility we have policy dynamics to take hold There's a big options experee. I think you know that chance 17 options experee I think there's a lot of options that were tied to that as people look to you know Even before elections they set themselves up for where do I want to be positioned through position through the change of power Etc. So I think those are the things to look at but I think if anything it really is a time to start squaring away themes on You know both secular and structural and looking to two thousand and twenty five energy is really underperform Health care is really underperform. I actually think they can be defensive even with all the the Nassiness and the health care that it seemed to be the headlines Those are the kinds of things I think you should be doing on a week like that Mike coge and 17 is that on your calendar and interestingly that's before earning season That's also before the inauguration Yeah, I mean actually January 31st is what's on my calendar as far as S&P volatility is concerned I actually just towards the end of the day today picked up some SPX strangle some 30 delta puts end calls Which are actually up a little bit you're looking you're just showing the vix index there It's not as cheap as I would like But actually the tims point you know the relationship between volatility the price of options going out three six months On a lot of the big single stocks relative to index are indeed a little bit rich And so I'm kind of with him there. I mean it's it's kind of an inside baseball trade to start thinking about talk You know trading correlation But uh, you know, I think that trade actually sets up pretty well I would want to own the inauguration though because I think there's some geopolitical stuff that could come out right on the back side of that We're not just talking about tariffs, but you know What is what's going to go on in Russia and Ukraine things like that? You know, we could get some kind of late January surprises on the geopolitical front that I think you want to be prepared for I agree with both of these gentlemen not that I disagree with you But on the options I've been doing some collar selling upside calls taking that extra premium You're able to buy a put that's closer to the one I'll let's get to some breaking news and DC lawmakers right now debating the latest stock at funding bill That could prevent a government shutdown at midnight eastern time a vote expected to come later this hour Say we see Emily Wilkins got the latest from Capitol Hill Emily Hey, Melissa. Well house lawmakers are now debating a bill that could keep the government funded until March 14th on the house floor But the big question is we know that Republicans are behind this because they all met earlier and most of them basically agreed to go forward However the way that they're bringing this to the floor is going to require strong democratic support And at this point we don't know where Democrats stand House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries is meeting with Democrats now just a couple floors below where I am When we were trying to ask lawmakers as they were walking in I saw whip caster and Clark She's the number two most powerful Democrat in the house And she said then she's going to talk with the caucus. She's going to hear members out She's not planning at this point to to whip yes or whip no Of course that leaves a big question as to exactly how many lawmakers might wind up signing on to this Certainly now that that two-year extension of the debt limit is out one of the biggest concerns for a lot of Democrats It's no longer a problem many of them support leaving the government open They support that a hundred billion dollars in disaster relief. They support helping out farmers and agriculture workers But it does remain to be seen it has been quite a bumpy process up here in Capitol Hill nothing is sure until it's final But we are expecting to know Hopefully by the end of this hour whether or not this bill is going to be able to pass the House and then of course The action goes across the Capitol to the Senate where lawmakers are eager to go home But waiting to see what the House does first All right, Emily. Thank you Emily Wilkins in Washington something we will be watching very closely in the next seven hours Or so as a shutdown looms. I'm gonna ask this question. I don't know the answer to necessarily maybe I can't believe it I know I can't either Even either way okay because all of what is surrounding all of this debt ceiling stuff with the Elon Musk tweet and you know Is is government dysfunction which was one of the reasons why the US credit rating got downgraded earlier this year And so here we are on the verge of a shutdown and what happens if we actually get downgraded again What do you think which yields what do you think we could make the argument either way higher or lower? Depends who's downgrading and if it's S&P. I think it's a big deal I think it's it's certainly it's nothing will feel like it felt in August of 2011 when we lost that triple A And plus and it seemed like it was you know the world coming to an end the reality is The US is still the most credit where the government and and borrower in the world in the deepest market etc But what we've heard from credit rating agencies is that US politics do matter and that they're starting to matter even more And then you add that to fiscal dynamics We recite these numbers often in terms of percent of GDP debt servicing Requirements and and burdens and where we will be over the next couple years So I do think it's a big deal I do think that the headlines coming out of the last 48 hours in DC are Suspension of debt spending sorry limits In other words for two years possibly and again that's at least the headline and that's part of the rhetoric around this deal I don't think that's gonna happen Yeah, I don't think that happens either. I did happen to look at what what companies are rated the same as US debt today Which moody's I think S&P is double it AA small a I know there's a different way to say it and that would be apple for example an excellent credit And if we were to lose that the next wrong would there was an exon which would have been Similar similar rated to the if they were to lose that We have another downgrade So the market will tell us whether it matters or not right they're able to fund their debt doesn't it? This must be an unwritten rule that the corporations are not supposed to have better credit Than the actual software they can't Here's the sovereign Exactly here's the sovereign ceiling is what we said back in the day. Yes All right meantime no fun or does plunging nearly 18% for its worst day and over two decades after giving data on its next generation weight loss drug Kagrasemma the drug helping patients achieve weight loss of 22.7% on average more than others currently on the market But short of the 25% expected and just in the last hour the FDA approving elay lily zip bound to treat obstructive sleep apnea The stock adding to its gains in the extended session for more let's bring in bmo senior research analyst Evan David Seagerman He just cut his a novo nordist price target to 105 a share from 156 Evan great to have you with us Thank you for having me it wasn't just a headline number on weightless what weight lost 22.7 But it was also the side effects only 57% proceeded to the highest dose which would indicate that the side effects were severe And so how much does that ding Kagrasemma as a viable product? It really challenges Kagrasemma. I think there had been hopes that you got something 25 26 27% weight loss with a tolerability profile Similar to zip bound The nose that bound is the leading product you're at the apex of tolerability and efficacy I think it's important to note that was zip bound. I think 36% or so of patients had 25% more weight loss So it is highly efficacious and this was novos answered is that bound now they feel like they're kind of lost And they might be viewed as lost on the oral obesity as well Novos oral obesity is a large molecule pill which is much harder to manufacture than elay lilies smaller molecule Pill and so are they losing on that race as well or Could it be that they acquire a small molecule drug from a smaller player? Well as it stands they don't have the small molecule So they are losing you have phase three data coming for lilies or proclifferon mid 25 Merck just ink to deal on for an oral clip one so that they're now in the race I think they do need to get into this space. That's how you brought in the market There are other small players who talked about structure on this program And that could be a viable option for novon ordis but the fdc would have to clear something like this which could happen under the new administration So what have is so is it just elay lilies in the pole position at this point it's elay lilies race to lose It is I would say I think over the summer I called elay lily the goat of obesity and that's definitely playing out You have a superior product you got the osa approval that six million more patients in medicare You know potentially more patients on therapy next year I think the one issue that we're looking at with lily is they need to hit four q numbers and have a good 20-25 guide same issue with novo But that's what's really riding on sentiment for the stock. I know the stocks up You know 30 some odd percent year to date novos now down almost 15% so to keep that momentum they have to have a good four q Evan when you look at this class of drugs We're talking about weight loss so whether it's 20% or 25% Seems like that's in the right area where you should be losing weight is the next metric going to be Muscle mass and it will other candidates really start entering into the fray Well, that's a very good point. So we have talked a lot about muscle mass and quality of weight loss Right now. There's actually no way to get that approved by the FDA So we have to have some regulatory updates So what I think is most important is you know maintaining the weight good tolerability right this derailed the novo program And potentially more extended dosing frequencies right dosing once a month once every other month. That's why people were interested in amg It's meritide Evan. I'm curious um does this stumble by novo nor does prove that the smaller players actually have a shot in this game Either by commercializing a product or being bought because it was thought maybe even a week ago that these two big players They're so deep pocketed. They've got such a deep pipe one but the smaller players They may not necessarily have a place in the race. I mean, this is thought on I think when say when murk bought the You know preclinical acid you saw a Viking infrastructure both down. So I think Yes, there is a room for the smaller players probably not a standalone They do need to either partner or get taken out completely and I think that's how you know a large farm of player That's not in the space like you know novartists and no if you name it could get in or novo nor does could catch up Who in 2025 will be bought do you think? Oh, that's a tough one. That's a tough one I think structure actually establishes a partnership with the farm apartment. That's what they've been saying I don't cover a Viking but I know a lot of folks hope that Viking gets taken out All right, Evan. Thanks for joining us appreciate it. Thank you so much. Happy holidays everyone you too Evan Seagerman of Bimo The structure CEO actually talked about that partnership right here on fast money during obesity week In terms of Eli Lilly in the stakes remember in October the horrible sloppy quarter because they couldn't explain what was going on With demand And so that's what he was referring to in terms of the bars high for earnings They need to actually have a good earnings pran without any questions. Yeah, I mean no right We asked that demand question was really an issue because we always say we don't have problems if they're unable to fulfill demand Right is it is it you know a sale denied or sale delayed? Hopefully they will clarify that I mean, I don't know if they clarified does get back to where it was that 900 plus I don't know yeah, but I am long Mike Yeah, I mean I think that the difficulty here of course now we just had that shortage issue and it's kind of funny actually because you think about it Had we actually seen the FDA keep it on the shortage list that sort of would have spoken to that demand issue obviously would have been You know fighting with the compounders a little bit, but that still would have indicated that you still had that sufficient demand I actually as far as health care is concerned I mean, I'm actually going to step away from names like lily I think there's obviously a lot priced in for the next 10 years while these patents hold up run the GLP ones that they have and they're They're obviously the front runner But take a look at health care in general and you're seeing something that's basically traded sideways It's trading at less than 20 times forward as a group that includes the hospitals you're talking about You know the medical device makers and everybody else in the space and Health care is going to grow faster than the economy overall. I mean most forecasts have it around 13% faster growth over the next 10 years than Then the economy is going to grow and it's kind of hard to see how that as a group doesn't start to play some catch up after under performing for a while All right coming up return to sender FedEx giving back all of last night's games during today's session Why investors aren't sure this transport name can deliver the goods that's next plus cruise lines cruising higher The numbers behind this year's monster games from carnival royal Caribbean and more as investors get bitten by the travel bug right after this This is fast money with Melissa Lee Right here on CNBC CNBC has quick and easy to understand business news updates at the open midday and close every weekday Markets money and more from Wall Street to Main Street. I'm CNBC's Jessica at Ingrid follow and listen to CNBC business news updates wherever you get your podcasts Welcome back to fast money FedEx giving back all of its games from last night the shipping giant had been up as much as 11% in the post market After announcing earnings and plans to spin off its freight trucking business shares open training Today up more than 6% but return those gains throughout the day and close out just in the red Tim why well I sense that the setup for the shippers overall isn't great. I think there's pricing pressure. I think there there's margin pressure Pricing pressure can lead to margin pressure. I think the the spin-off news was the excitement there This was part of this is seemingly a non-core business has been running in its own silo has its own cargo fleet Etc. We wanted to see that FedEx is cheap, especially when you sum of the parts it So that explains the move we had but you still have to answer to the macro Okay, so it's just it's the macro that is pushing it's not Amazon is going to be a major competitor or is that part of that Dynamic I look I mean you tell me I mean you you PS is down 47% from a peak in in in You know February of 2000 the union issue to which is different than FedEx Which has been a headwind if you if you pull up a chart five year chart of both FedEx and UPS You see the divergence between the two and also FedEx lowered its outlook and they miss estimates on revenue Right, although UPS was up to the oh yeah, yeah So no that I guess maybe I think my co-girl alluded to this last night that the maybe the full value of the spin was already reflected in the after hours numbers and that the spin is really a year plus off so So Seems like a long time to wait now, but yeah, I did not listen to the call so I don't know if any of the the body language wasn't so optimistic about the quarter but Um, they did guide a little load. Yeah, Michael. Would you make it the fade? Yeah, I mean, you know, it's an interesting thing because obviously it's only you know It's less than whatever 10% of their business. We're talking about the LTL or the LTTL Karen if you'd be like the less than Then truck load which actually makes some sense It was something that it occurred to me once or twice before but take a look at some of the competitors In that space they didn't trade well look at old dominion for example that traded very poorly today and a reasonable question One might ask is you're taking a look at a very mature Business that doesn't seem like it has a huge mode that's growing it less than the S&P and is trading at a premium of about 30% To earnings when you're taking a look at this LTL old dominion is trading like 32 33 times forward I think that's kind of hard to get your arms around to it And I think that it's actually putting more scrutiny on some of those names now that people are looking at the FedEx spin-off as well So I actually wonder about that whole group to be honest All right, there's a lot more fast-minded to come here's what's coming up next We're in the final stretches but 2024 isn't quite over yet from small caps to the titans of mag 7 crypto and beyond Our traders are unveiling their charts of the year But first cruising higher cruise lines are trading like the kings of the high seas But is there more smooth sailing ahead? We'll dive in Next you're watching fast money live from the Nasdaq market site in time square. We're back right after this CNBC has quick and easy to understand business news updates at the open midday and close every weekday Markets money and more from Wall Street to Main Street. I'm CNBC's Jessica at Ingrid follow and listen to CNBC business news updates Wherever you get your podcasts Welcome back to fast money the travel trade continuing to soar airlines higher today and up big over the last three months American Delta jet blue all up double digits united jumping nearly 87% in that time cruise lines also setting sail today The group rally after carnival's strong earnings report continuing their strengths since the end of September Excuse me the summer a travel booking company expedient also nearly 30% over the last few months A state deflag the yet cruise lines so I've been in Viking holdings since the start when they went IPO And it's a smaller issue and no one even looks at them the stock is up 80% Basically from when they went IPO, but if you look at Norwegian it's up 34% royal up 85% in carnival up 45% year to date It's not just about vacations because Marriott is only up 20 something percent High it only up 20 something percent It's on board spending. It's attracting a lower age bracket when you were growing up how old were people one on cruises When I was growing up. Yeah, like retired people were gone cruises. They're probably younger than us though But but older older people and now it's more of an excursion of then it's a family event You go on with with your immediate family your extended family So you go on as groups you spend more money on you you spend more money on excursions It's a cooler thing to do. It's experiential So you have airlines that get you to the cruise cruise that are out performing and hotels that are I'm not gonna cop to a cooler thing to do. Okay, I'm Just like you know what your costs are going to be right? So when you're trying to figure out like how to navigate and and limit your spending because you're your pinched or what? So you're not spending any money once you get on that cruise you you try not to understand again I'm not a cruiser you can not spend anymore money Because what you pay is for the room and for food. Okay alcohol too or no? No Well, you can buy an alcohol package. I've known people that sounds like Steve. Yeah, I'm gonna ask a couple of friends I've known people have done that Yes The airlines that we were just flying in some nice performances. Well, it's it's interesting that both cruise lines and airlines were Were trades that although there was upside-ball and there's all kinds of fits and starts on these trades coming back from COVID It took them two to two and a half years to really hit their stride or to be There's got to be a great metaphor upon like a full flight cruising altitude But they finally got there and and and if you think about it with airlines It's always the story of capacity It's always the story of discipline and you're always waiting for the airlines to to really fall out of bed Anybody that's shopping for airline tickets right now knows they are not falling out of bed Not only are airline tickets holding high levels, but it does seem like the planes are full So from an investor's perspective me delta's had to you know, it's pulled back You know 15% from those from those highs. I think you're probably starting to nibble at this week. Yeah, Mike how about you? Yeah, I mean, it's interesting first of all that huge out performance that we saw in united was really because it had underperformed delta And you know these things are flying full so You know, they're really in a very strong position and united still trades at a mild discount I know that sort of delta is everybody's favorite in the group But you're probably getting it about a half a turn cheaper if you get in on united and they're basically dealing with the same dynamics So, you know, I like the space, but I think united is still actually a decent buy here Coming up 2025 is frighteningly close, but we are not done with this year Just yet our traders are unveiling their chart of the year from crypto to interview right after this Mr. Moment of fast catches any time on the go follow the fast money podcast. We're back right after this Welcome back to fast one of the major averages clawing back most of their midweek losses in the back of encouraging inflation data But still down on the week the doubt jumping 498 points the SB up 64 points and the Nasak up about a percent Starbucks falling nearly 1% to close out its fourth straight losing week at the longest weekly losing streak since May 2023 Workers at at least 10 stores going on strike is contract negotiations stall And Trump media falling after the president-elect transferred all of his holdings in the name to a revocable trust That's now up less than 2% since the election and finally Berkshire Hathaway upping up stakes in oxygen petroleum series XM and verisign according to a new filing the Oracle of Omaha's firm investing more than 500 million dollars across Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday and with the last full trading week of the year in the books We thought we'd take a look back at 2024's major moves from tech to high flyers to cure reversals And it's time for the traders to lay out what they think is the chart of the year 2024 see you grass. Oh, I mean you have to go what might for me you have to go with micro strategies And if you look at how it's out performance with the underlying Bitcoin It's probably a three and a half to one out performance you look at it This could be the chart of the week the chart of the month the chart of the year It's the chart of the year for these purposes It'll probably continue to be the chart of the year for me Are you in micro strategy and would you rather micro strategy over big one? Wow, I'm not in micro strategies now. I am in Bitcoin through the grayscale minis Would I rather? I probably should be in micro strategies if you but I don't like it it burns both ways the three and a half out performance is also out performance to the downside So I'd rather just be in Bitcoin. I know what I'm buying all right Tim My chart is the RSP equi-ecoated S&P but the relative under performance of Equi-ecoated S&P to S&P so I'm not sure what chart we have here But but ultimately if if you look at what equal weighted has done throughout the year first of all We are closing the year essentially at relative lows against the S&P that broadening of the market that we are so excited about over the summer which was a almost an 8% move in July of Equi-eated and and value plays and the broader market Which is since Thanksgiving has been a straight nose dive lower so as you can see this ratio chart kind of shows you where we started the year It's 12% of under performance and again, we're back to those same seven or eight stocks and it's it's pretty interesting because I would have said a year ago Hey, I don't think the S&P is gonna ever be 36% seven stocks Again, and in fact, it's well, that's where it is now if you include broadcom as the eight stock you're at 36% It's slightly bigger as the concentration as was a year ago. So I just think it's fascinating that markets have that roller coaster entry year So would you rather into 2025 equal weight or S&P? I'm gonna answer it with a caveat that if I think rates are going higher I want to own the top seven stocks. I just think they're gonna be more defensive But I do believe that this is a time to be buying the broader market Karen what's your chart? It's actually very similar to Tim's in its concept So my chart is the mag seven versus the iwm and so getting to this what what generated the over performance the mag seven Very strong again after we think about what a big year they had last year and on top of that to continue with this out performance And then the iwm even though a lot of things set up nicely for it lower rates maybe not as low as we hoped but A regulatory environment that might be more hospitable to them Mergers for example and the banks doing better Didn't matter. It didn't matter and so ultimately we get I think I peak Out of divergence at the very end of the year that's surprising to me. Would you rather? You need to ask the same question I want to switch it up. I mean if I already asked the two times the row Ask hard to my co Mike. What's your chart yet ready Mike? Yeah, I mean so Steve's picking a chart that looks really interesting to the upside and Tim looking at one to the downside I guess on a relative basis Karen too. I'm looking at one that's just going sideways So energy has gone sideways all this year. It's actually gone sideways effectively for 10 years If you went back 10 years, this is essentially a dead money trade I am thinking that there might be some opportunity for you know a potential rebound this year if we see you know enough Ticking some other areas these things don't really trade that expensive. So you know I'm kind of looking at this for 2025. Maybe this is the year All right Coming up American Express cash again on big gains this year why this name is at the forefront of the financials and the pinnacle of payment stocks next Plus you're running out of time to get those final stocking stuffers Tim Fortunately, it is time to find out which retail stocks have been naughty and which have been nice more fast money into You're looking at a live shot of the house floor where lawmakers are voting on the latest spending bill the bill needs 283 votes in favor to avoid a shutdown at midnight Tick tock all right You know the picture reminds me of remember when tarp failed and we're like sitting on our screens and we shot at October yes, it was hard to believe anyway, sorry Meantime American Express that to end the year on a high note the credit card company rising yearly 2% today And is now up almost 60% this year that makes it the third best financial stock in the S&P and puts it far ahead of payment names like master Card and visa and max also getting a rush of price target hikes in recent days as analysts rush to catch up with its recent run The average price target of $2.92 still lower than where it closed today Mike, code you like American Express they tend to have higher income folks They who tend to pay their bills and fall Yeah, I mean American Express has some things going forward I felt like management had some pretty big missteps with their affinity cards a couple of years ago But they seem to have gotten past that and look it's trading less than 20 times forward and while I still like master cards growth rate a whole lot better It's trading 32 plus times forward So that one's a little bit harder to get your arms around so you got this one at a discount to the broad market growing at least as fast And you know obviously doesn't have the same kind of an issue if you have a consumer spending slowdown because of the demographic that you just mentioned Yeah, I think they demographic so you could see you stated a mastercard up 24% year to date American Express up 60% Visa around where master card is Walmart showed us where they were getting all the business from right the higher income Family and now when you look at you look at you can look at the home builders tall brothers They cater to a higher more affluent network of people American Express This is save them So if the market turns down they're more insulated by it sort of go down less than the others and it goes up more than the others in a boom They're not kind of American Express had always been that a business spending businesses are to curb their spending their budgets Etc travel then American Express gets hurt What kind of environment do you think will be in next year? I think you know the the business environment will remain pretty robust I think if anything there's there's more confidence to to spend and to maybe spend on it some CapEx opEx, but I I guess I little you know I worry about a stock that's doubled in a year and a half in a world where all we do is talk about consumer credit Even if it is a more affluent group it's the question is can you have the kind of year that you've had for the last 18 months I don't think so and while the valuation isn't terrible It's not that cheap so I don't know if I need to chase that next year Well the valuation is not terrible, you know, it's actually I mean it's high for itself historically But they've sort of grown into it. I think and I think that affluent customer. Maybe it's not a business Maybe it's not it's just a you know a person an affluent person. Yeah, they're spending this year. They're going on cruises Right, but they're going to think about I really would be curious American Express how much Taylor Swift business did they do for real Really that that I mean how much did you give them? That's fair enough too much. Yes, I did. Yes across people not just you Only three of us But still yes, and and that having across the country and there's so much spending that goes alongside with it You know to the travel if you keep So if that's the case and the tour is no longer and the tour is no longer will you and you're on year are the cops worse No Taylor Swift bump the cops are gonna be far. Wow. I mean what do you Michael You know you would know the answer I am not I am not a big Taylor Swift fan, but Holly absolutely is a big Taylor Swift fan And she wanted to go and she wanted to bring the kids, but the boys are not really Taylor Swift fans either So that that plan sort of fell by the wayside But if if she could have found somebody else in the family that was willing to go with her She'd have dropped the American Express card on that thing in a heartbeat. I'm sure so you wouldn't go Mike I mean Dan went in a Kelsey's I mean that's embarrassing I don't know I don't think so I'm not a big concert person to begin with Coming up. It's the final stretch in the countdown to Christmas So what is in store for the retail trade with the holiday season could mean for this group next and here's a sneak peek at the Cramer cam Jim is chatting exclusively with the ad coast to you catch the full interview top of the hour on mad money more fast money to You Breaking news on the vote on the house funding bill Emily Wilkins is in DC with all the details Emily Amelissa we can now say that the house has enough votes to pass the stopgap bill that will end the shutdown tonight And continue the fund to government until mid-March now of course nothing is the final until the vote is closed But at this point they do have the two-thirds support needed with Democrats coming in to help Republicans push this bill over the line Once it clears the house it will go to the Senate and the jet fumes are heavy up here lawmakers want to get home for the Christmas holiday We are expecting the Senate to move quickly on this the house has shown that it's bipartisan Elon Musk even tweeted that he thought Johnson did the best that he could so it seems at the 11th hour everyone is coming together We will have more updates on exactly when the Senate votes But it seems like the worst case scenario at this point is a short weekend shutdown And the best case scenario is that lawmakers are jumping their flights before the end of today Melissa Emily. Thank you. Emily Wilkins All right Christmas in case you didn't know just four days away So for you last minute shoppers out there Tim there's only one weekend left to take everything off your shopping list among the big retail winners this month Victoria secret build a bear five below urban affidels and ultra beauty all up double digits So is there more momentum ahead for retail and of course remember this is a compressed how they shopping seasons So maybe this weekend Has even wore at stake Karen Yeah, I knew we were talked about this before this compressed and I don't think it matters I know retail say it does but Tim you could have you always wait it doesn't matter Yeah, it's part of this between things. It's right on pressure. He's not getting it done But I would like I'd like retail I feel like the cost the consumers feel are feeling good If you have any if you have assets in the market you're feeling really good. I like hold to I like TJX. I like gap And I have Louis Vuitton which has a big good right? I think it's fascinating the way some of the discretionary spend Especially the apparel especially those names that have been leading for the last you know year have gone look at Decker's again Guys focus and and I'll see you we can get them both in the same company and that stock is not that expensive here So I think it goes higher all right up next final trades It is time for the final trade but before we go around the horn I just wanted to briefly say best of luck to my good friend Tyler Matheson who is retiring from the anchor seat after 27 years at CNBC It has been an honor to work a long side of you Tyler. Yes. What a great send off that was today. It was I was here I was honestly in the year. She's great man. Well, we'll miss you Tyler. All right around the horn we go my co Yeah, health care is growing faster than the broad economy But the sector is trading cheaper than the S&P. I think you could buy XL. Sam that tough time in the spirit space for Diaja, which is the global spirits leader I think a brand that is got high brand power and I think the top line starting to grow again Karen yes, I like the oh I ate which is down for this year, but it's
