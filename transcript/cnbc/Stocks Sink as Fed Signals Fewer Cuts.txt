I'm Melissa Lee come to you live from studio be at the Nasak on the death tonight Karen Feinerman Dan Nathan Courtney Garcia and Michael Contopolis director of fixed income at Richard Bernstein advisors And we start off of course with the Fed decision that sent markets really today the Dow sinking more than a thousand points logging its longest losing streak since 1974 the S&B down nearly 3% of the Nasak dropping more than three and a half The small cap Russell 2000 leading the losses in the worst day since June of 2022 This after the central bank lowered its benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points and indicated there could be just two more rate cuts next year Down from the previous forecast of four the 10-year yield topping four and a half percent for the first time since the end of May meantime the dollar index closing at its highest level in more than two years gold prices pulling back a third of a percent And the volatility index crossing above 23 the highest reading since august and some wind coming out of the sales of top performers since the election Bitcoin down over five percent while other momentum trades saw steep losses Tesla for instance down more than 8% micro strategy saying 9 and a half percent for more on all this let's bring in senior economics reporter Steve Leastman Hawkes pause Hawkesh. Yeah Hawkesh pause. I talked about that yesterday in the day before and nobody wanted to believe it The Federal Reserve cutting rates is expected by a quarter point to a new range of four and a quarter to four and a half percent But offer a more Hawkesh albacon future rate cuts that really spooked markets in the doubting just how many more cuts could be On the way in 2025 I think from this point forward, you know, it's appropriate to move cautiously and look for progress on inflation So how the Fed freak out markets what a forecast only two cuts next year not three as many in the market assumed There was one descent but three others in the dot plot without a vote wanted no rate cut four banks Could be the same but we're probably not the same did not ask for a discount rate cut a sign of what their boards and maybe their president Wanted and they raised their inflation inflation on like for 24 25 and 26 in addition several Fed policy makers appeared to have begun the process of incorporating Potential fiscal policy changes into their forecast from the incoming Trump administration that could explain why average inflating inflation forecast went up for 20 25 with specific concern about tariffs Powell said those threats introduced uncertainty into the inflation outlook Well, what happened to the probabilities? January that is out March in doubt may Getting more likely you get that next cut June more solidly, but look at that December second cut The market has not really priced in a second rate cut for 20 25 You can see that more clearly. I look at that doubt by the look at it December 20 25 Fed funds futures construct trading around 4% with a big rise today. It shows little conviction in that second cut that would send the funds rate below 4% The situation could change if you get better inflation numbers or weaker unemployment data That could make those cuts more likely and perhaps even molasses some clarity on what president elect trump plans to do with tariffs I would also offer about half of more than half of the post election trump bump in equities is now gone That's a good point there the situation could change Steve if inflation numbers come in better They could also change if inflation numbers come in worse And and the moving to two seems like it's allowing themselves sort of the leeway to reevaluate So I'm wondering if there is anything in the Fed's language because they also said the economy is performing very very well using two varies in the press conference I mean all these things add up to me like There's the door open to a prolonged pause much longer or maybe even a hike possibility down the road I think that's right. I don't think well look. It's important to point out That Powell also said the Fed is a meaningfully restrictive still at this level That tells you there is some tolerance for inflation remaining where it is or going a little higher Before the Fed gets around to doing what you're talking about Melissa and hiking rates There's some tolerance in there. Nobody really knows how much But if the committee becomes convinced that inflation is no longer headed or no longer has confidence that inflation to have a few percent I believe they will hike rates, but the question becomes how and when they incorporate the incoming fiscal policies from the administration Steve, it's Karen. Thanks for being on today I was a little surprised the magnitude of the 10-year move in light of what I thought was somewhat Clearly hawkish hawkish hawkish from Powell that you know since the 10-year was sort of Can this 10-year was reflecting concern about You know would we just have wild growth and inflation and then and that This I would think would maybe conversely have sort of this hawkishness Would have actually given a little more support to the 10-year and I thought or is it just inflation could be high and that's what it's about I think that's part of it. You know, I'm informed a little bit by a scott walk. There's interview with Jeff gunlack Who talked about the idea that you really can't make a strong bet on rates going down anymore? I think from let's call it the summer maybe a little earlier Through the fall you could say all right. I'm going to take a position on rates coming down And it was a pretty secure position. I'm not sure you could take that anymore. Where would you put rates? It may be that we're at the top end here in terms of where the 10-year is I agree with you that it would think that given that hawkishness the Fed was going to be leaning further and more strongly On inflation in the coming year that it otherwise had been but I also think you know Melissa's question is not an idle one she has her finger on the market as good as anybody and if she's asking Steve Our rates going to possibly go up next year. Well, it must be a salient risk I would say I don't know Well, let's ask Michael Contapples is on the desk tonight Fortunately, what do you think because I mean just yesterday or the day before we were talking about T-Rogue price They're had a fixing come saying 6% next year. Yeah, I don't know if we'll get to 6% next year I mean maybe over the course of the next economics like I guess if it's the start of a new economic cycle then Certainly we could get there, but Listen, what world is the Fed restrictive? I just don't see how that could even be uttered with a straight face I mean they're looking at some hypothetical neutral rate. They're looking at the real Fed funds rate saying L We're restrictive but remember the transmission mechanism of interest rates is to affect lending Lending standards are reusing credit spreads are at all time tides. You got speculation and markets and Bitcoin You know banks are easing lending standards There's plenty of liquidity out there the the effect of rates has not filtered through to the economy Obviously, so I would argue that they're not restrictive I agree with the sentiment about the tenure You know, you would think that if you're going to tame long-term inflation and growth expectations the ten years should stabilize not go up But I think this is much you know more to do with a knee jerk reaction Than anything else and I wouldn't take too much out of today's price action I think we have to see how that plays out Over the coming days before really understanding how the market takes this Steve I'm curious when Powell was talking about the 2% number he said Effectively that they're committed still to 2% but it may take much longer than we were expecting it may take another year or so Does that jive with what he said in the past or is that a longer time frame? Is that inflation fight going to be more attractive than we think? I had the same thought when he said that is that showing us that he has more tolerance for inflation running above target than he previously did I think the thinking here is that It's not broke in the extent that you have unemployment relatively low relatively contained the job market is a little bit looser And it's not as he said several times A threat to the inflation story here and so I think what he's saying is at this point given that growth has been pretty good Given that unemployment's been pretty well behaved I'll take a little more time and not try to break it in terms of pressing further on the economy I think that's what he's saying right there But I think what was said by the previous guest there was really fascinating this idea that The market doesn't necessarily believe that the Fed is restrictive here And therefore going to have a Positive effect in terms of bringing down inflation. This is a big issue here worth debating if you think the Fed is restrictive I'm going to win this inflation battle you can back bank on more rate cuts if you don't think that as the previous guest does not Then you cannot take that that that stand on more rate cuts coming next year Steve. Thank you Steve Lisman from Washington for us So where do you stand on that point Dan? Yeah Listen, he's the smart bomb guy. I'll talk about the stock market. I'm kind of the dumb stock market guy too So go back to late 21 I think we can all agree there was clearly a stock market bubble right and we had this crazy period of late 2020 2021 everything that wasn't bolted down was going up fed funds was basically on a zero interest rate bound The 10 year was about two percent or so so it was at you know It was doing okay, right and so relative to fed funds Well, what happened when the fed signal that they're going to start raising interest rates right to battle inflation these That stocks got killed right the Nasdaq went down 38 percent over the next year right So I think about what's going on right now if you are kind of taking off the table further cuts or or you know Three four like a lot of folks were kind of expecting in 2025 Then you have to start thinking about valuations you have to start thinking about this dollar that is gone from 100 to 108 That's the US dollar index the Dixie and you have to say to yourself all these stocks that have pulled forward so much performance Right they're anticipating double digit earnings growth in 2025 now they have serious headwinds We were talking about that yesterday right? We're talking about the dollar We're talking about where yields are and whether likely to go with yesterday We're 4.4 today. We're 4.5 if they go to 5 percent if you don't think that the Nasdaq and the S&P have a down 20% move from here at some point I think you're not doing this correctly So to me, I think fact set has about 15% expected EPS growth in 2025 If the dollar stays here if yield stay here that's not happening I think the one thing we also have to think about is why rates might not be coming down right because I think it's interesting you're seeing this Michael you brought up a good point and knee jerk reaction I think that's exactly what you're seeing today because the bond markets have been pricing this in I think we all knew that the Fed was going to have to either start pausing here or cutting less than they were expected to But if they're not cutting because the economy is strong and prices are still stable That's very different than them having to cut one or two more times next year because they need to save the economy And if you're in that position where the economy can continue to grow Unemployment stays low at these higher rates. I don't think that's a problem for a lot of the equity markets in general You're seeing this new jerk reaction specifically on some of your rate sensitive sectors So things like real estate seems like small cap are clearly playing off today But inflation is going to be a concern next year So you want to have those inflation hedges in there because that could be a problem But you want to make sure you balance that out so in that scenario that you laid out Courtney Does that mean that these dips in some of these high-flying name? I mean do you go in and buy big cap technology? And I think that's what I don't want to boil it down so simply But I'm sure a lot of people homework thinking you know what nasack down 3% 3.5% is this my chance again into an envy Is this my chance again a debit coin? I think what you have to look at too is even though this is how to dip These are still doing so well since the beginning of the year so when we look at our clients Most people are so way overexposed to these we've been trying to get people to take some profits off the table Even with this dip that's still the case So is it by our country probably but most people I was there so overexposed to it So I think that's something you need to balance out Without being a you know a little bit cliche and sort of the tale to markets next year I mean you could easily see a scenario where you go into next year profit growth is reasonably strong You know this rise in rates ends up and the sell-off in stocks gets washed out because of the strong growth environment all the promise of You know the fiscal policy that might be coming under Trump etc Only to see earnings growth start to slow as you get later into the second quarter into third quarter And at the same time restrictive policy right start to bite a little bit and that way to dance point It is very reminiscent of 2022 just rather than run away inflation You have higher than average inflation instead of you know an earnings recession You have slower earnings growth instead of a Fed that's hiking you have a Fed that's pausing all coming off of elevated Equity levels and tight spread levels that does not vote well. I think for back half of 2025 But near term I think the signaling is actually reasonably strong I think the pullback in banks is actually really interesting I don't think that the environment for banks the backdrop for banks which have you is very positive. Yeah, right? I think you've got You've got growth in loans because you I do think the animal spirits are still there I think you've got great potential for M&A good capital markets and they're not crazy expensive and so This pullback I think is attractive. I would be adding Yeah, I just had one other thing and I know we don't price in geopolitical risk But if I look around the world I cannot remember the last time there's been so much uncertainty look at what's going on in Canada right near us Look at what's going on in Germany look what's going on in France look what's going on in Russia and Ukraine Look what's going on in Syria in the Middle East look what's going on in China and Taiwan and that's not just the only point I want to make here China's economy is a disaster Okay, when you think about this we have disinflation here and they're worried about a reflation right of that But look at what's going on there. They might be like they might export Deflation to all the points, you know around the world that is not helpful to us one way or another and if you think about this dollar It's going to continue to go higher under that scenario So I just think this is a really messy year and then you think about what we learned about President-elect Trump's first admin There's just going to be so much rhetoric that moves around CEOs don't like that sort of uncertainty especially when Things are going great here fine If we have to worry about tariffs and then we have to worry about weakness all around the world in a strong dollar That just does it set up for a great scenario that gets you to 15% year-over-year earnings growth in my opinion For more on today's decision, let's bring in former Cleveland Fed President and CEO Loretta Mester she's also a CNBC contributor Loretta great to see you Nice to see you Well, is your take of J. Powell's press conference is forward guidance specifically Yeah, I mean, I think it played out exactly as expected I mean, I think coming into this it was clear that The Fed should be thinking about pausing and I think he made it clear that that's what's on their mind the dot plot showed Half as much reductions last Next year as the former dot plot did which is exactly right I thought something significant he said was that they have reduced the degree of a strict in this quite a bit And I think that's important because I think that's kind of where their mindset is So you think about what they were doing since September's recalibration now going forward This is really about balancing those risks making sure that they keep the funds rate at an appropriate place so that no matter how those uncertainties that you've just been talking about play out They're in a good position to address them either by holding at that current rate for much longer than anticipated or if things on the on the Employment part of the mandate we can more than they expect then bringing the the rate down faster So I think they're still in a good position here I think the markets are are reacting in a way that's kind of interesting because this was I think pretty well expected But maybe it emphasizes that there is still a lot of uncertainty out there about the economy For next year including what fiscal policy actions we're going to see The reddit's Karen thanks so much for being on given how hawkish he was and how he had statements like you know um more cautious in the future That sort of thing and kind of the reluctance to even make this cut Can you explain how did it happen that it actually did cut Even though the market seemed to be forcing them to not what goes on in the room that makes them come to this conclusion Yeah, so I think you know going into this meeting I'm sure there are a lot of people who came in saying you know, I could see it going either way You come in sort of with your formulated view They did nothing In the intermeeting period to really persuade people that applause Was likely to happen at this meeting and more importantly it why go forward with it? Well the narrative surrounding the economy hasn't changed if you look at the dot the projections And what chair pal said at the press conferences They still expect inflation To come down toward 2% over their forecast horizon It won't get all the way to 2% but they expected them to be moving down and they still expect Right the labor market to remain healthy Yeah, I tick up in the unemployment rate over time, but still a healthy labor market It's just going to take a different policy path to get those outcomes So it will take probably more restrictive policy Certainly more restrictive than they thought in September And that would be the reason to keep to go you could go forward with the rate cut of 20 my basis point As long as you coupled it with the information that they gave us in the communication which was look From here on out we're really going to be thinking about each meeting and and looking at the The cumulative information. So the way I think about it is over this period where they were recalibrating Coming in to the meeting it was Has is the evidence you start with the base case we're going to be cutting and now what's the evidence that would sort of say go against that From now on I think coming into the meeting is we're not cutting at this meeting What's the evidence? What's the cumulative evidence that says okay, we can resume zoom those cuts That's how I would be thinking about it now So it's basically a subtle change of you know, what's the base case going into a meeting And then what is the accumulated evidence tell you okay? Is it time to resume we can bring it down another notch Because inflation has a resume coming down and we think it's on that path towards to or Right is it now we still haven't seen the progress on inflation and so we're going to hold Pat for another meeting And that's how I think about it So it's a subtle change in sort of what the base case is going into a meeting the overall You know forecast remains the same that eventually they'll be moving rates down because the economy is going to get back to 2% inflation LeRat, my contopolis here I mentioned earlier that the transmission mechanism of you know higher federal funds rate is through credit channels And what you ultimately want to do is either slow or speed up right the availability of credit And that's really the sort of how interest rate policy works So when you look at credit channels out there It's still argue they're incredibly easy and actually getting easier bank You know lending standards credit spreads etc So yeah, I know the the fed real fed funds rate is elevated and I understand that we're above some theoretical neutral rate But does anybody actually sit in the room and talk about the impact of higher rates and how it's affecting credit availability Or is that just you know assume that it's going to at some point or another Now I mean we talk they talk about that in the room and I certainly we did when I was there We looked at you know the overall set of financial conditions and of course the fed produces its own indices of these things But you know on the other side of that if you think about how many people have And households have low rate you know fixed rate mortgages right that's that's something that works against the transmission of lower rates into the economy So again, you know Temenzo what sector you're looking at whether the transmission mechanism is is the typical one or not And I think the way the chair you know likes to put it is he looks at sort of what's happening On both sides of the mandate and if you look at the employment part of the mandate You have seen some moderation on the employment side so that's and you have seen inflation come down on the inflation part of the mandate And so that would be an indication that policy is restrictive from the point of view of what the Fed controls and therefore You know we're getting back to you know price stability and full employment But I think the real key thing is there's risk around that and one of the risks you're pointing out is that perhaps financial conditions Arnest height and that manifests itself today in looking at what the Fed Participants think the long run fed funds rate. It's not exactly You know what a neutral rate would be at any point in time but over the long run the fed funds rate And it has moved up in those projections and in fact one thing I noticed in the SCP today which I found very interesting is That over the forecast horizon even by 2027 the fed at the Fed funds rate their projecting is above Still restrictive relative to the long run fed funds rate that wasn't true in the September SCP So again, they are projecting that they're going to have to remain more restrictive Than they thought and over the full forecast horizon Well, right. I always great to get your take especially in a day like today. Thank you. Nice Melissa That's your happy holidays to you So Karen your view of the markets for 2025 yesterday versus today has a changed no not really No, I mean we're all we're back. I don't know 10 days ago. Some things are down more so no No, but higher. I mean this is this is sort of like higher for longer. I didn't think I was not thinking there would be many multiple cuts. Oh, okay, so you weren't you weren't in that camera. I'm short the 10 year Right, so I you know I thought because I think we'll see inflation So no nothing really changed. Yeah, how about you? Yeah, I'd agree with that I mean I think if you're if you're watching what's happening the expectation was that the fed was probably starting to get ahead of themselves This was likely going to happen so I don't think this should change your bigger picture I think one thing that probably changes is the fact that all that cash is sitting there It's probably going to sit there longer because of people think oh, I'm still going to get over 4% of my money markets Why do anything with it? So I think that part of the market's probably stays where it is it doesn't start to funnel its way in I don't think that's a bad thing for the markets, but that's one less catalyst of upwards Yeah, so what changed for me is just like to see how quickly investors sold the fateful eight And and that's really the most important point are the biggest eight stars. Oh, yeah $8 trillion you haven't heard that yet my great. I know I've heard it. Okay. I just Show no, but I think that's What's really important and the other thing and you know I've been in this camp that I think that there's going to be this period next year Where there's over capacity and a lot of stuff that the cap X has been spending on and I think just the fact that you're going to see a Deceleration in the cap X Microsoft's been telling you that the numbers and Microsoft have best basically been Notching lower a little bit Satin Adele and Dan Niles pointed this out was on Brad Gerser's podcast last week He said he is not constrained on chips anymore. What does that mean? It means their cap X is going lower. Okay, so he's constrained on power But that's also been a bubble. So what's clear to me is that the generative AI bubble There's some air coming out of it. It just depends how far you think it could go and the only thing that I'll just finish on is like We've seen a pull forward in a lot of the excitement about the activity that's going that that's been clear I could have said that I did say that two months ago three months ago But to me it's more about the narrative and then if you get the narrative right Then you're not going to make a mistake at all time highs like a lot of folks have over the last call it month Or so because that's the real danger here if we were to have a sustained selloff Coming up much more today is monster selloff with 96% of SB stocks ending the day in the red Is this an opportunity to buy or is there more pain to come and we're watching some after our transaction shares of micron and linar on the move after reporting results of details and numbers from the quarters Next don't go anywhere fast when he's back and two You Tomorrow Taylor Morrison CEO Cheryl Palmer on the housing outlook for 2025 mortgage rates and inventory and the challenges facing the home building sector Stay ahead of the market squad box tomorrow six a.m. Eastern CNBC Welcome back to fast one a developing story in Washington. We're present to elect Trump along with JD Vance and Elon Musk are taking shots at house speaker johnson's proposed three months stopgap government funding bill could this all lead to a shutdown Emily Wilkins is pasting the halls on Capitol Hill to find out the latest Emily Hey, Melissa. Well, it has been a very interesting day up here on Capitol Hill We began with a 1500 page bill, but not quite sure on the timing to vote on it But now that bill itself isn't jeopardy all day long We've had Elon Musk and the vaekrom swami raising concerns about the bill urging lawmakers to vote no and then Elon Musk coming out with tweets saying that those lawmakers who voted for this bill would be Primarily and basically would be forced to give up their seats or lose them in an election That seems to have made a lot of lawmakers here pretty nervous because we went from thinking that the stopgap would have a vote by the end of today to no more votes by the end of today We've also seen reporting that says that leader speaker Mike Johnson is actually looking at a slinned down version So instead of a bill that had a lot of provisions in it a lot of spending in it Just one that focuses on funding the government past that December 20th deadline and then adding additional confusion and chaos to the mix President-elect Donald Trump and incoming a vice-president J.D. Vance Both tweeted that while they do want to see a stopgap bill They want it to include disaster aid currently at a hundred billion They do want it to include aid for farmers currently at 10 billion So they want some of the spending provisions They have also called for that to include a raising the debt limit If you remember Republicans had a big fight of this in 2023 They kind of kicked the can down the road to January of 2025 And now Trump and Vance are saying that Republicans need to get it done That is a very heavy lift usually negotiations over debt ceilings and debt limits They can take weeks they can take months last time it it took half a year And so to call for it with less than 72 hours on the clock before a government shutdown Is really raising a lot of eyebrows here on Capitol Hill And there's just a lot of uncertainty at this point about what if anything the house is going to be voting on And whether it can get support needed to actually cross the finish line So we are monitoring the situation very closely and we'll continue giving updates as we have them Melissa Emily thank you Emily Wilkins Honest question here Do the markets care about this now or will they care about it on Friday? What do you think? I mean I think the Fed decision today is going to outweigh this I think this music going to go and notice I do think yeah Friday this is going to be much bigger story All right We've got Narnie's learned on Lennar the home builder down about What is it a couple percent now missing on the top and bottom line santa ola has a very latest santa six percent A rough q4 for Lennar they blamed it on mortgage rates and they're not wrong The average on the 30 year fixed started September at a recent low close to six percent But then shot up over seven percent and guess what it jumped 21 basis points this afternoon to seven point one three percent After the Fed release that according to mortgage news daily Lennar's new orders fell three percent year over year and were far short of guidance deliveries down seven percent Gross margin of 22.1 percent a little shy of estimates now Lennar chairman steward miller said in the release in the course of our fourth quarter the housing market that appeared to be improving as the Fed cut short term interest rates Prove to be far more challenging as mortgage rates rose almost 100 basis points through the quarter Even while demand remains strong and the chronic supply shortage continue to drive the market Our results were driven by affordability limitations from higher interest rates He added that Lennar adjusted sales price incentives and margins in order to reignite sales and manage inventories Melissa conference called tomorrow tonight Dan. I'm just curious to might have the fan tomorrow Okay, so there be a lot of questions to be asked about mortgage rates. Yes Okay, Diana. Thank you. Diana O'Leak What do you think? I mean obviously we could be in for a prolonged period of higher rates here. Yeah Yeah, well, I mean housing remember is a high multiplier industry So anytime you have higher rates that starts to affect the housing sector that typically is not great for you know the rest of the economy I think it's probably too soon to make that conclusion based on just today's price action even this month's price action But yeah, I mean listen to higher rate higher for long environments certainly is not good from that perspective Yeah, how about for your home depot or lows just sort of correct that I was more think about Zillow Which also had a very difficult day. I mean Zillow does have a rental business that which has helped sort of somewhat as a ballast but You know this higher mortgage this high this quit is not great. All right court The only interesting thing about higher rates in this industry It means that there's less existing homes that are going to be sold right because the average Mortgage right now is 4% so rates are closer to seven They're not selling which actually puts your homebuilders a little in a better position because of the supply demand constraints So out of its as bad rates being high for them as it would have been in the past without that without that situation All right Coming up more after ours action chairs of my plan on the move after reporting their latest results the details of the quarter next you're watching fast money life of the Nasak market site and time square back right after this Tomorrow Taylor Morrison CEO Cheryl Palmer on the housing outlook for 2025 mortgage rates and inventory and the Challenges facing the home building sector stay ahead of the market squat box tomorrow six a.m. Eastern CNBC Welcome back to fast money my cruncher is tanking despite earnings at beat estimate the chip maker issuing week Q2 guidance that conference call is underway SEMA Modi joins us with the latest SEMA Melissa my crown remains challenged by week mobile and PC sales Smartphone unit volumes in 2024 are expected to grow in the mid single digit percentage range and in 2025 CEO Sanjay Mahodhar has expecting low single digit percentage growth as consumers pull back Executives also add at autos remain soft with a shift towards value vehicles from premium and electric vehicles Which in turn has slowed memory and storage demand onto the bright spots though because data center sales from my crown did rise 400% in the quarter from a year ago My crown more than double to tie bandwidth memory revenues sequentially during the quarter Demand is so strong that hbms are sold out for calendar year 2025 which is part of the issues how can it increase supply at a faster rate Micro and also revealing that it's latest hbm will be designed into and videos black well GPUs But shares are giving up gains down 13% here and after hours trade amid a broader tech route chips not performing well today SEMA thanks SEMA Modi It sounds like it's the old old lines of business stand. It's not a statement on AI PC's You know and smartphones and the one takeaway I would say really quickly and auto and industrial okay And they're also telling you okay about capacity constrained for memory that goes into the servers well Let's see let's see if like jensen Wang says that the black well demand is insane because if it's not then somebody like Micron's gonna have a lot of problems here especially with those other end markets that are are very weak And the one thing I'll just take away again apple is one of their largest customers apple iPhones did not grow this year They are basically flat. There's an expectation that they're going to grow mid to high single digits next year I don't think with some of the news that we heard that they're working on a full of all iPhone They're working on a thin iPhone apple intelligence as a joke I don't think it's going to be a big upgrade cycle until the fall until they have these new phones And then it goes back to the question with apples multiple that's expanded five points based on no real growth Why is that happening? You know, I mean so like at some point there will be a reset if you don't start to get some indication By some of their suppliers that things are going to be better than expected and right now microns not telling you that I think jf warring came out with the note today about apple and how apple intelligence isn't Drawing people and that's the 16 is actually tracking worse than the 15 So there's not traction gain off of this for an upgrade cycle Yeah, I remember I was talking about this back in the fall when the phone came out because it's kind of this carrot They're dangling where they say oh, we're gonna have AI and then they came out with the phone They said oh, it's AI enabled but the AI is not actually be on it And now we just like don't know what it's gonna happen Yes, I think I agree with you. I think this is gonna happen a lot later than we expect and I don't know if it's this like super cycle upgrade people hoped for Maybe down the line. We're not there yet I agree with everything you both said I wonder what you think Dan what is baked in I think that when it was first released I think the I think there was not a lot of optimism that there would be A jump you know this wouldn't be huge Certainly until at least they enabled some of the AI series still the worst product imaginable I think that the expectations are kind of muted for the 16 still even valuation is still rich, but I don't know do you think that there's very bullish expectations? I think expectations got really high almost immediately the stock rally right after Wwdc on June 10th for the next two days up 10 percent It's a three trillion dollar market cap company and then it kept on going It sold off and came back after that august you know really august kind of swoon I think the thing that makes me nervous like a bunch of these other fateful eight stocks over the last call it two weeks or so I mean look at the move that apple had it went up 15 percent into today's all-time high Before it reversed It's just dangerous behavior when that when the fundamentals don't seem great although it's a much-loved stock And the you know like so to me. I just think that again. We're seeing pull forward pull forward pull forward This is why you know liquidity is so important I mean, this has been a liquidity driven market more than anything else and why today's fed rate decision and what's going on? Interest rates I think is really going to be a key driver of markets next year Coming up everything you need to know after today's massive sell off the doubt now on its longest losing street since Gerald Ford was in the White House the impact on your money when fast money returns Missed a moment of fast catches any time on the go follow the fast money podcast we're back right after this oh Welcome back to fast find another check on today's market sell off after the fed Signaled fewer rate cuts next year the Dow plunging more than 1100 points the S&B down nearly 3 percent The Nasak falling more than three and a half percent Financials getting hit hard the XLF down nearly 3 percent with big banks all in the red Charles Schwab continuing is decline the broker down nearly 4 percent today And more than 10 percent since hitting a new 52 week high last Thursday And some changes to the S&B 500 HVAC company Lennox International will join the benchmark index before starting of trading on Monday Replacing biotech Catalan who's acquisition by novo Nordisk closed today Dan you signaled you flagged Schwab Oh, yeah All today No, I just figured it out once you ask me question I try Yeah, I'm just surprised when you think about the sort of retail interest in so many different of these names And the volume that we've seen and not just inequities but ETFs and options so to me a future I wouldn't expect this thing to slow down anytime soon as far volume is just because the stock markets down But again, I just think the price action is Schwab was kind of curious and but it had a massive run into this right I mean to Karen's point on financials not much has changed because of this fed meeting I mean the fed underscore the point that the economy is very very strong right to varies in the description of the economy also J. Powell highlighted the fact that the unemployment rate. It's the same levels July I mean things are pretty steady as she goes here and we have deregulation coming so that That thesis if you believe in it still exists Yeah, and I think you hit the nail on the head when it comes to the deregulation because that was the big bump up We got post election on financials was due to the fact that they're one of the big beneficiaries of a deregulatory environment And today they're getting hit on higher rates theoretically But they're basically brought back to those pre election rate pre election values at this point in time So all that deregulation bump has basically been taken away, but that opportunity hasn't so I think if anything Yeah, it's a buying opportunity you want to take advantage of all right Let's get more in today's posts of fed sell off with Ben Emmons of Fedwatch advisors Ben great to have you with us Um, I quickly read through your note your quick on that drawn in terms of getting this note out But bottom line you think yields are headed higher full retracement to 475 How high do you see it going in this environment in this new environment now? Yeah, Mel is as Paul said right we're kind of shifted in environment He admitted that himself and you know, it was interesting to see that forecast come out because by Showing a high inflation forecast is showing particularly in the back end the the members of the FMC Upside surprise to the inflation outlook. I think that's what triggered the sell off today in the market Bleeding rates and that spilled over them to the broader market and yes, you're breaking four and a half years We talked previously so 475s the high of this year. So that's an easy with the tradesmen But to an earlier show from from April I believe it's 5.3 by the reason that's really the upside there and if I calculated that that Taylor will really quickly on the forecast from the Fed today It's actually what the Fed funds rates should be today 5.3. We're about 80 based points easier So there's a lot of opportunity here for yields to go higher I think given the Fed's change in tone and change in reaction function today So how do you piece that environment for equities together for next year if we are to say that rates could glide higher To above you know just above 5% or so what we are also looking for you know the conditions for a stronger dollar Maybe slower earnings with I mean how do you sort of put it together in terms of what the environment Is for equities? I don't think it will necessarily be a deteriorating environment Because you know strong dollar better growth high yields. That's so talks about that very very good economy as Paul said and I don't Think on that under that condition that could actually sell off majorly I think we have to just sort of digest ourselves to an environment where the Fed may not just simply be easing any longer So that's I think today's in digestion Before the outlook that I don't think changes anything other than if you're getting inflation really coming back meaningfully So the Fed wants to get ahead of that inflation by being you know more Focused on inflation their forecast. So I think it's a good backdrop I think the corny's point of deregulation is a key element next year including to the tax cuts That will continue to drive the sentiment Which is have to get used to a Fed that's going to be likely on hold and show a little bit more like force on inflation I think that's the only thing that could help hold equities back That it's kind of thanks for being on yesterday. There's a big piece tired T. O price of five or six percent even Ten year and one of the things they cited was foreign governments not participating as much do you see that happening and adding further pressure to the tenure? It's possible Karen because you know that's a good point by T. O Yeah, we talked often times like the Fed doesn't have only sorry The US doesn't have a deficit problem has actually a debt maturity problem And in other words, we're just financing too much with debills. We got to move that out to curve That's still not really priced in. I think that's what keeps maybe these foreigners away bit from the oxys as T. O Analyzes because if that's the case in removing higher deals We got to see those high yields first before the former foreigners come back So I would agree with them. Not sure if six percent will be the end destination It's more like they're above four five percent, but that's reflective of an economy I think that emerged next year Stronger towards more five percent growth. So that's good for equities, but yeah, a bunch. You should be higher Ben thanks for joining us appreciate it Ben Agnes of Fedwatch Michael earlier you said you didn't see six percent you saw five, which is what Ben sees and I'm curious Did that number ratchet higher based on today or no? No, not really You know, this was pretty much our base case We didn't think the Fed should have been cutting really at all so far this fall so We sort of anticipated that they're probably going to have to slow down the pace of cuts And therefore hasn't really affected our outlook too much, but um, yeah, so I think nothing's really changed to hey Michael um Fed funds like What can the yield on the ten year go to six percent and Fed funds not go higher like meaning like can that happen in your mind because again You made the point you know, there was I don't know T-Row or somebody said that they think there's going to six percent Just think back to like I don't six nine months ago. I mean rickton telly was on on our desk It was talking about seven percent. Yeah, he's seven ten, you know, we were here in that Jamie diamond said prepare for six seven And so that's one of the biggest shifts that I think we've seen year over year But can we see yields on the ten year go much higher without the Fed starting to raise rates? um You know when you think about what the backdrop would be to get to a six percent ten year It's probably one of pretty aggressive growth and inflation And in that world the Fed would try to slow it They would probably get behind the curve similar to what we saw in 2022 they'd start slow they wouldn't believe it So on and so forth So I think it would be difficult but the stock market would hate that right? Sock market well, I think it depends on uh, I think it depends on how quickly you get there If you got to six percent and it happened very fast the stock market would hate it because of the volatility component If you did it over the course of two or three years and it was gradual growth Then I think it's a very different answer for the stock market And so I think how you get to that six percent level Would really would really matter I do think we will see a six percent handle. I just don't think it's going to be likely this cycle yeah exactly In 2025 coming up mercs super size obesity bet white a farmer company is going on lean on an experimental pill out of China And whether the move could help share stage or turn around that is next more fast money and two Well Welcome back to fast money mark down nearly two percent after inking a deal to acquire an experimental weight loss pill from Chinese drug maker Handsome farmer mercaying one hundred twelve million dollars up front with the potential to tack on an additional 1.9 billion of certain milestones are reached Importantly the oral drug hasn't been put to the test in human trials yet smaller biotech developing their own pills dropping sharply today turns Viking structure therapeutics We talked to all of them during our obesity week. They're all down double digit In terms of losses today, and you know the thinking is that Merck was probably one of the most likely big farmers to acquire one of them Merck license this deal with the Chinese farmer company And so maybe it's out of the running in terms of doing an acquisition of these smaller plays But what do we how do we feel about Farma in this environment With healthcare sentiment so bad in general I feel like we've seen healthcare sentiment be so bad over election yes Over election cycles were all the rhetoric and ever you know a bipartisan and everybody hates it and all of that And yet they still seem to rise. I mean that's interesting about Merck They can afford to sort of make some bets out there. Yeah, I'd like to see the Gardasil situation Improved. Yeah That I mean that way then the stock heavily. Yeah, but this really does show you I mean Merck is down 1.7% which is you know not better than overall markets in today's session That this is really the holy graph for for those with pipeline challenges. This would be a tremendous You know opportunity absolutely. Yeah, and I think this is a much bigger deal for these smaller firms like for example Like Viking therapists about 18% today versus almost 2% the Merck was down So I think it's a bigger deal for some of these companies where this was again something post election Everyone said oh, we're gonna see M&A. We're gonna see more deal making They're gonna buy up some of these smaller firms now. They're saying maybe that's not gonna happen in the obesity space And I don't know if that is the end of this or if you know they could do both I think that's a question So I think you're saying a little bit of any jerk reaction here But I do agree with Karen sentiment. I think it's so people are so negative on it and you know kind of un For reasons we don't really have any basis for at this point in time that it could be an opportunity Up next final trades You Do not miss the reveal of CNBC sports 75 most valuable college athletic programs tomorrow live on CNBC CNBC calm slash sport starting at 6 a.m. Eastern time time for the final trade. Let's go around the horn Michael Contopolis of RBA given the big sell off today in great relative earnings growth I'm going with small and mid-taps over the next quarter or so great to have you on the desk. Thank you Karen I do like banks still financials. I like Wells Fargo. It's only been like 10 minutes since you like them before I still like them. Yeah, you tell these ex until you've done 10% over the last couple weeks I would not be buying this here. There's a couple things that are wrapped up in higher for longer and also this kind of generative I trade so I do for me Yeah, I agree with Karen here I would take a look at the banks think they were really hit on the fed like the hawkish cut that we saw today I think when it comes to deregulation, I think that's gonna
