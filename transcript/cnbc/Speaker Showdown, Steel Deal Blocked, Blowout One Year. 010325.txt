 global markets up to the minute. Front page news. Wake up to Frank Holland and Worldwide Exchange weekdays 5 a.m. Eastern CNBC live ambitiously. I'm Frank Holland and you're listening to CNBC's Worldwide Exchange. Our show is live weekdays at 5 a.m. Eastern. Listen in. It is 5 a.m. here at CNBC Global Headquarters. Welcome to Worldwide Exchange here is your 5-5. Stocks are riding the longest daily losing streak in months. Futures, however, they are pointing to a rebound. A sector shake up just two days into the trading year possibly showing a sign of things to come. And I'll speak to Mike Johnson faces his latest leadership test in a crucial vote today. Why investors should be paying attention. Plus shares of USDO they are plunging on reports President Biden has made a decision on the proposed $15 billion takeover by Nephaw. And later nearly one year since the Boeing door plugged low out, the stock still struggling to recover. It's Friday, January the 3rd, 2025. You're watching Worldwide Exchange right here at CNBC. Good morning and happy Friday. Thanks so much for being here with us. I'm Frank Holley. We begin with the look at US stock futures with the S&P, the NASDAQ and the Dow. All of them starting the year lower the S&P on its longest losing streak since April. But take a look at futures. Seeing a bit of a rebound right now. So the S&P up about a third of a percent over 20 points. The Dow up also up just about a third of a percent. About 140 points, the NASDAQ, the best performer right now up just about a half a percent. Right now we want to take a look at the S&P 500 pre-market gainers. Take a look here. Right at the top of the list. This is a stock we see at the top of the list for a few days here. Cooper Co followed by Las Vegas, Sans obviously has a gaming company. Constellation energy, Targa and beachy properties rounding out the top five of gainers in the pre-market. So the beginning of the year showing what could be a shift in leadership energy. The best performer, you can see yesterday, the best performer after being a laggard in 2024 and then consumer discretionary. A laggard after finishing last year is one of the best performers you're seeing the moves right here week to date. We also have three sectors that remain in correction territory. That's materials, healthcare, energy and real estate. Yeals. They've been steady, but they still held above 4.5 percent, which appears to be at least one factor putting pressure on the market. Take a look. The benchmark at 4.55. Down about five basis points from levels that we saw last week. One story when it comes to the 30 year though, it's held right around 4.75, 4.77, even kind of touching 4.8 over the last few days. Julian Emmanuel out with a note just a few days ago saying, bonnills on the long end of the curve, that's the biggest threat to the cyclical bull market. Also, we want to look at currency, the dollar in particular, also continuing to strengthen now hitting a two year high. Pulling back just a bit right now, but week to date, almost up 1 percent. Just to put this in context for currency, these are big upside moves. Again, the green back up just about 1 percent week to date, pulling back just a bit right now. We want to look at oil, also starting the year rising on hopes of economic growth all around the world. Take a look. Pulling back a bit right now, WTI pulling back about a half or a percent, but here's the important part. Above a key sentiment level of 70 bucks a barrel right now, trading at about 72, 75 a barrel, similar story for Brent Crude. Pulling back right now, but well above a key sentiment level of 75 bucks a barrel right now, trading just above 75 50 a barrel. We want to take a look at gold and at crypto this morning, taking a look right now, going to remove these circles, of course. We're seeing gold pretty much flat, but again, trading very close to, well, just moving fractionally higher as I'm speaking, but trading very close to a high right now and a bit coin pulling back 1 percent, but back above 95,000 still well below, it's all time high of 107,000. Okay, that is your setup. Let's now see how Europe is shaping up as this trading day gets underway. Our Sylvia Amaro is in London with a look at the early actions. Sylvia, happy Friday. Good morning. Happy Friday, Frank. So European equity is actually started the new year on a positive note. We had the benchmark. The stocks is 100 up 6 tens of a percent on Thursday, but that's changing. Let me show you what I'm talking about. Looking at the major forces across European continent, we are read at the moment. There are several reasons behind this, but one of them is the fact that investors have been digesting weak economic activity out of China. And of course, they could have ramifications for European companies too. So let me show you how the different sectors are trading at the moment. So you get a better idea of what is the corporate dynamic at the moment. At the top, we have financial services. We're up about 7 tens of a percent. Oil and gas is also up 6 tens of a percent. Oil and gas was actually the best performing sector on Thursday and that positive sentiment continues today. But I want to focus on the worst performing sectors because that's where the most important market narrative is at the moment. And look at it, we have orders down by more than 1 percent. Basic resources also down similar levels. And that shows, Frank, clearly that it's those Chinese concerns that are having ramifications on European forces today. Let's see what will happen, but perhaps we are not going to see that positive performance that we witnessed at the start of the year continuing today. We'll see. All right, Sylvia, thank you very much. Sylvia Marrow, live in London. We're going to stick with the overseas action now. Take a look. These are live pictures on your screen from Seoul, South Korea. Officials there halting an effort to arrest and peach president Yoon after an hours-long standoff at his residence. About 2,700 law enforcement officials, they went to Yoon's home to serve in a arrest warrant that is valid until Monday, the move coming just one month after Yoon shocked the entire country and its allies by declaring martial law only to lift that about 6 hours later. It's unclear if the agency leading the arrest efforts will make another attempt over the weekend. We'll have much more in this story throughout the hour. Again, live look at Seoul, South Korea right now. All right, time to have for a check on some of this morning's top corporate stories, including a long-awaited decision from the White House. Our Pipa Stevens is here with those. Pipa, good morning and happy Friday. Good morning, Frank. The shares of U.S. deals thinking ahead of the open on reports President Biden has decided to block NEPON's deals proposed $15 billion takeover. According to multiple reports, the president opting to kill the deal despite efforts by some senior officials warning a rejection could damage U.S. relations with Japan, NEPON and U.S. Steel have threatened to take legal action. Should the administration try and block their merger attempt? Our reports say an official announcement could come as soon as today. Meanwhile, meta-platforms is shaking up its policy team. Just days ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, the company says Nick Kleg, a former British Deputy Prime Minister, and its global head of policy since 2018 will be stepping down and replaced by former Republican staffer and current Vice President of Policy Joel Kaplan. Kaplan served under a former President George W. Bush and appeared at the New York Stock Exchange with Vice President-elect Vance and Trump in December. And new details on the Treasury hack attack, according to Bloomberg, Chinese state-sponsored hackers were able to access unclassified materials stored locally on senior officials, computers, including drafts and notes for policy decisions, itineraries, and some internal communications. Now, the agency is still reportedly assessing what was taken, but notes that hackers did not compromise the department's email system or its classified systems. Frank? All right, Pipa. Thank you very much. We'll see you a bit later in the show. Turn it back to the market. Stocks are looking to rebound from a down start to the New Year. Two big concerns. The dollar close to a two-year high and rates in the U.S. staying higher for longer. Let's now bring in Doug Bonaparte, President and Financial Advisor at Bonafide Wealth. He's also a member of the CNBC FA Council. Doug, good morning. Happy New Year. Great to have you here. Morning. Happy New Year. Let's just start off with the moves in the market over the last month. About three percent over the last month in your mind. Is this a viable dip? Should investors just be loading up on some of these stocks that are down, or is it a sign of maybe some trouble in the New Year? Yeah, I think we're seeing some volatility here. Three percent dip. Not sure. It's screaming by, but you should always be buying, right? Averaging into the market. So I think we're in purgatory with the markets. We got a new administration coming in. It's a big wait and see kind of month. Should you always be buying? That's actually a question I think a lot of people are asking. Remember a couple of years ago we had a Tina trade. There is no alternative. Now you'll just start and get a little bit elevated. Remember all that money in the money markets right now? I just checked. 6.85 trillion. Everybody said that's going to come out. That's going to be a big tailwind for the market. But it's actually grown over the last year despite the rally. In your mind, is standing cash, standing bonds, standing money markets? Is that more attractive than the market, the stock market right now because of the volatility? For long term investors, no. If you're investing over the long term, you're going to be begging for today's prices 10, 20 years from now, right? Whether it's a home or at the stock market. But even if you're a long term investor, don't you need to make short term moves changes to your portfolio? I mean, even if you're planning for the next 30 years, you've got a 30 year horizon. Don't you want to get in and out of some sectors to some areas just that are showing some weakness right now and maybe put money back in there later? At the very least, the rebalance here at the front end of the year might be a good move, right? You've probably baked in some risk from outperformance. So the equity is from 23 and 24. So you're heavy on those equities. You can cycle out to your fixed income positions or other areas that have lagged the Mag 7 or large caps of the world. All right. Speaking of the Mag 7, I want to ask you about this. This is a question I think a lot of people are trying to figure out. Are the Mag 7s? Are they growth stocks? Is that the AI near to this going to push the market higher or the defensive stocks? They could be both, I guess. But I want to look at the Mag 7 over the last month. I'm just kind of using the last month because that's when we started to see some of the weakness in the market. The Mag 7s up 3%. The market's down 3%. So what are the Mag 7 in your mind? Are you worried about the nearness of the market? Are you worried about over-concentration or should we just be loading up on these because they just continue to work? Yeah, they do continue to work now, don't they? Now whether they're defensive, I chuckle a little bit, but they're saying that because of stability and earnings, you got basically dominance in the market. However, you don't have to go too far back in time to 2022 to see what happened to technology and some of those Mag 7 stocks overall is pretty brutal out there. So I still view them as growth. If you're doing the AI play, you definitely are speaking to growth there, but they're strong. There's no doubt about that. So I know you're always talking to the long-term investor. I know you're always talking about the long-term investor. But I want to ask you about some of the change in leadership we've seen to start the year. Energy being the leader, consumer discretionary being the laggard. It was consumer discretionary. It was one of the big winners last year. Should you maybe be allocating towards energy? Do you see a big rebound in energy this year? Oil prices rising as well? Should you maybe be putting money in healthcare after it had a really tough year last year? Is now the time to put some money in some of those laggards or again, just keep riding the wave? I view there being no issues with having a slice of your portfolio in sectors that you feel strongly about. I'd be a slice though. Talking 5% up to 10%. So very small slice. Yeah, we're not talking very large allocations to the hunches you have around sectors that you believe will perform well. But that 5% allocation to see if you're thinking is right. It's not necessarily a bad idea, but we're largely broad-based investors. Let me put you on the spot. That 5% you're talking about. Where would you put it? Would it be healthcare? Would it be energy? Could it be small caps that are almost in correction right now? Where would you put it for the hopes of a big rebound in 2025? That's a really great question. I come on here. I like digital assets. I still think there's an opportunity there. But I like energy. You've been talking about it. I think there's an opportunity. If we do see rising oil prices, you're going to see appreciation out of the energy sector. All right. Doug Bonaparte. Always good to see you. Good to see you very much. All right. Coming up here in World Wide Exchange. We have a lot more to come, including the retail turnaround story that Stephanie Link says. This is her best idea for the year ahead. But first we go to Capitol Hill. Head of a critical day for House Speaker Mike Johnson and for Wall Street. Plus Sunday marks one year since that Alaska Airlines door plug incident that has resulted in a very costly year for Boeing and Ford shareholders. 12 months later, we're going to get the analysts take on the stock and on the company. Very busy hours still ahead. World Wide Exchange returns. Stay with us. Weekdays at 5 a.m. be first on World Markets. First to the global business conversation. Get a jump on the investing day every day with Frank Holland. Success starts early. World Wide Exchange 5 a.m. Eastern CNBC. All right. Welcome back to World Wide Exchange. It's time now for your big money movers. That's three big stock stories of this morning. Let's start off with shares of Kervana. They're down just about 4% in the pre-market after closing about 2% lower yesterday. This is after short sale. Our Hindenburg resource disclosed a new short position in the company claiming its recent turnaround is quote, a mirage that's being propped up by unstable loans and accounting manipulation. Kervana calls the report quote, intentionally misleading and inaccurate shares of Kervana right now down just about 4%. We're also watching shares of Tesla trying to rebound after closing down 6% yesterday shedding more than 70 billion in market value shares right now up just about 1.5%. So the move yesterday coming after the company reported its first drop in annual deliveries for 2024. Tesla shares are currently riding a five session losing streak again, rebounding a bit today up just about 1.5%. And Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway coming off its best year since 2021 outperforming the S&P 500's 23% gain and posting its ninth positive year in a row. The year also saw Berkshire class A shares top $700,000 for the first time ever as Berkshire halted its buyback program opt in to grow its cashboard and rely on investment income from some key holdings, including auto insurance giant Geico shares of Berkshire Hathaway just freshly hire right now. All right, turning out to developing story in the latest into the investigations into Wednesday's New Orleans truck attack in the Las Vegas cyber truck explosion. Let's get over to NBC's Frances Rivera in New York at the very late. Hi Frank, good morning. The FBI now saying the suspect in the deadly New Orleans attack acted alone. Others believe 42-year-old Shamsu Din Jabar is solely responsible for the New Year's day attack that left 14 people dead. The FBI says Jabar was also seen on surveillance video, placing two explosive devices in coolers near the scene of the attack. Authorities also found what has been described as the remnants of bomb making inside the Army veteran's home in Houston. That's according to a senior law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. The FBI also reported they have found no definitive link between the New Orleans attack and the explosion of a cyber truck in Las Vegas. Authorities have identified the suspect, that suspected driver. In that case, inside the vehicle, they found the military ID of master sergeant Matthew Livel's burger. Army officials say he served as a green beret and was based in Germany, but was on approved leave. Authorities are waiting on DNA confirmation but say tattoos also point to the 37-year-old being their suspect. According to a corner, the suspect sustained a gunshot wound to the head before the explosion was detonated. Officials tracked Livel's burger root from Colorado to Las Vegas using data from charging stations. The FBI searched at least one home in Colorado Springs. The motive in this case is still unknown. Frank, we send it back to you. All right, Frances. Thank you very much. Frances Rivera, live in New York. Coming up here in World Wide Exchange, the DC Wall Street connection and why what happens on Capitol Hill today? You could have some huge ramifications for your money. Stay with us.

We're going to have a look at the situation. We're going to have a look at the situation. Finally, a transit agreement that saw gas flow from Russia through Ukraine and into countries like Austria and Slovakia just expired, forcing countries to look elsewhere. Now, Kepler estimates that by the end of the withdrawal season, inventory will be at 44 percent down from 58.5 percent last year. As the world's largest LNG exporter, the U.S. is filling some of that gap, supplying nearly half of Europe's LNG last year. As James Baudell from Energy Aspect said, Europe is very reliant on LNG flows to help it refill its storage over 2025, meaning that strong competition with Asian markets and high prices. And of course, Frank benefiting the key U.S. producers. All right, so a lot of big upside moves. I think the real question here is how much more supplies the U.S. have to send to Europe and other places that may need natural gas? So right now, we are maxed out. It takes a very long time to get one of these terminals up and running. There are currently five under construction. And so the EIA says that by the end of 2028, we could double our export capacity. But it really has been a remarkable transformation because initially the U.S. was going to be an importer. And then in 2016, we exported for the first time down in Louisiana. And then now, as of 2023, we were the world's largest exporters, surpassing Australia and Qatar. And so the rest of the world is really now looking towards the U.S. to meet that demand. We are sending a whole lot to Southeast Asia. As well as to Europe, we supplied almost half of Europe's LNG last year. And so as they look to move away from Russian gas, the U.S. has really stepped up to be a key supplier. All right, as you say, it's the Widowmaker trade, though. So very volatile area of the market. Pipistievements, thank you very much. Good to see you. All right, still on deck. Attempts hours long standoff in a failed attempt to arrest and peach president, Yoon Soo-kyul, who are imposing martial law in South Korea exactly one month ago. Assessing the political uncertainty in the region will have that story much more. Also, if you haven't already, you should follow our podcast. If you miss Worldwide Exchange, check us out on Apple, Spotify, or the podcast apps. Much more coming up right after this. I was in constant contact with President Trump throughout this process, spoke with him most recently about 45 minutes ago. He knew exactly what we're doing and why. And this is a good outcome for the country. Elon Musk and I talked to within about an hour ago. And we talked about the extraordinary challenges of this job. And I said, hey, you want to be speaker in the house? I don't know. He said, this may be the hardest job in the world. I think it is. So that was Mike Johnson just two weeks ago in the heels of that 11th-hour deal to avoid yet another government shutdown and what could have very well been his last major play as the speaker of the house. Welcome back to Worldwide Exchange. I am Frank Holland, happy Friday. Coming up this half an hour, a speakership showdown. We're going to talk about what happens and what happens and what happens in Washington. Matters to Wall Street and what matters to your wallet. But first we begin with a look at US stock futures. With the S&P, the Nasdaq and the Dow, all of them. Starting the year lower, the S&P on its longest losing streak since April. Take a look at futures though. We're seeing a rebound setting up at least in the pre-market right now. So the S&P up just about 16 points rising. Just about a third of a percent. The Dow's up over 100 points. Also up right around a third of a percent. The Nasdaq, the best performer on a percentage basis. 80 points are just about a half a percent. We're going to look at some of the biggest gainers on the Nasdaq 100 in the pre-market. At the top of the list, an energy-dane, constellation energy. Those shares up just about 2 percent. Followed by AstraZeneca, applied materials, Palo Alto Network, Cybersecurity Player. And Tesla rebounding after a multi-day slide up almost 1 percent. So the beginning of the year, we're seeing what appears to be a shift when it comes to leadership. So energy, the best performer after being a laggard back in 2024. I know it's not really back just a few days ago. On the other side, consumer discretionary. Now the laggard at 2025. After finishing last year as one of the best performers, you can see consumer discretionary down. Almost 4 percent. Energy up almost 2.5 percent. And we also have three sectors that remain in correction territory. That's materials, healthcare, energy, and real estate. It's actually four. So yields. They've held steady over recent days. But there's still about 4.5 percent, which appears to be at least one factor putting some pressure on the market. Let's take a look at the benchmark. The 10 year, 4.55. Pretty much holding steady over recent days. Pulling back just about five basis points. But again, still above 4.5 percent. Different story when it comes to long bond. This is really held steady. Right around 4.75, 4.8 right here. Drillian Emanuel from Evercore saying, higher yields on the long end of the curve. That's the biggest threat to the cyclical bull market. We're going to talk about that with our market guest. We also want to talk about the dollar right now continuing the strength. And right now hitting a two-year high. Let's take a look at the moves in the dollar. Pulling back just a bit. Back about a quarter of a percent. Which you can see right here. Weak to date up about 1 percent. That is a big upside move for currency. And we want to look at energy, oil in particular. Starting in the year, rising on hopes of economic growth all around the world. We're going to start off right here with WTI. I'm going to remove this circle, of course. Pulling back just a bit. Back about a quarter of a percent. But over here, this is the important part. Above 70 bucks a barrel. Well above. Almost at 73 bucks a barrel. 70 seems to be a key sentiment level when it comes to oil. Brent crew. Also well above 75 bucks a barrel. Another key sentiment level. Training it almost 75, 75 of a barrel. But also pulling back just about a quarter of a percent right now. And we're going to take a look at gold and cryptocurrency particular. Bitcoin right now. We're seeing gold continues to move just higher fractionally right now. But still right about at a two-year high. Bitcoin pulling back a bit. Down about 1 percent. Remember, crypto currencies. They trade around the clock. Still well below. It's all time high of 107,000. But back above 95,000. Trading at about 96,445 right now. Okay. That is your setup. Now we want to shift gears a bit. We're keeping a close eye on shares of US Steel. They're sinking ahead of the open on reports that President Biden has decided to block. Nipon Steel's proposed $15 billion takeover. You see shares right now down over 8.5%. According to multiple reports, the president is opting to kill the deal despite efforts by some senior officials warning. Rejection of that deal could damage US relations with Japan. Nipon and US Steel have threatened to take legal action. Should the administration try to block their merger attempt? Reports say an official announcement could come as soon as today. Again, shares of US Steel. They're down more than 8.5%. Turning out to Capitol Hill and Congress convening its first session in the new year. With one major to do. Top in the agenda for day one. That's elect a new speaker of the House. But even with President-elect Trump backing Mike Johnson's re-election bid. It is anything but guaranteed. Emily Wilkins joins me now with more on this very consultal day for DC. Emily, good morning. Good to see you. Good morning, Frank Lea. We're about to find out if the new GOP tried to affect it. It's going to start the new Congress with unity or with chaos. If all members are present today. It will only take two Republicans voting for a candidate other than Johnson to deny him the gavel. Now Johnson is projecting confidence. He met with some of the holdouts yesterday afternoon. He struck a really optimistic tone when he left that meeting. People are talking through process change of day one. And those kinds of things. And I'm open to that. And I think tomorrow is going to go. We're going to go. Now there about a dozen undecided members. Many who want to see federal spending cut. The debt shrunk and some process changes. Congressman Ralph Norman, who's one of those undecided members that Johnson met with. He wouldn't say whether he thought we'd have a speaker by the end of today. But he did say yesterday that Johnson was in listening mode. You know, happy way of winning. I think most of the people that you ask the same question asked me would say the same thing. I'll wear it there yet on everything. No, but we're going to take it. Johnson is set to meet with some of the holdout members this morning. And hopes of getting them to yes before the new session. Gavils in at noon. And while a number of members did hold up Kevin McCarthy speaker. For 15 rounds, keep in mind that Republicans who object this time will be holding up their own party's agenda. That includes, of course, confirming Donald Trump as the winner of the 2024 election, as well as other policy priorities on border security. Frank. So Emily, a lot on the line today. What's the order of events? How do we see things playing out? So around noon, we're going to see them gavolin for that new Congress. We're going to do a quorum call and at that point, we will know the exact number of members who are voting today. That's going to be key because Johnson will need to win a majority of anyone who votes for a candidate. So obviously, if you vote present, that's going to go ahead and change a little bit of what we're going to see. Mathwise, remember, though, this is a long process, but it's a transparent process. They're going to call on every single member one by one, all 434 of them by name. That person is going to stand up. They're going to say who they're going to vote for. So we're going to have a very clear sense, probably around like 2,230. Exactly whether or not Johnson has the votes. And if he doesn't, who are the people who are opposing him? All right, another big day in DC. Emily Wilkins. Good to see you as always. Thank you very much. Joining me now to connect the dots between Washington and Wall Street, Stephen Whiting, Chief Investment Strategist and Chief Economist at City Wealth. Stephen, good morning. Good to see you. Good morning, Frank. All right, so all this political tension in DC questions about the House Speaker getting the election certified. Does that actually matter to investors? Well, look, I do think that investors will really care. If this is an indicator of whether the Republican majority will work together to get things done or again fight amongst themselves. So that'll be useful, I think, in a process. I'm not going to argue that it's going to be the difference in whether stocks rise or fall today. But as we look deeper into 2025, this is just going to be one of those indicators. And obviously the process last year showed that there could be a long and arduous process. It doesn't really mean that much over a short period of time. But once you get through this and you get deeper into 2025, all sorts of issues will arise. In the second quarter of the year, the Republican majority will deal with their own increase in the debt ceiling. So these are the types of issues that markets will care about and really assess the functioning of the new Congress. All right, so it sounds like this could impact sentiment. So kind of leaning on that thread of impacting sentiment. President Trump, he is back, John, Senator V. The House Speaker. A big part of the rally we saw post election was the idea that President Trump would have a lot of support down in DC, who would have support in Congress, support in the Senate. If Johnson doesn't actually become the Speaker, or if this becomes a prolonged process, does that change investor sentiment about the idea that the Trump policies will be enacted when he takes office, that he'll have a lot of support when it comes to Congress? Does that change that narrative and change what sectors you think people may want to invest in? Things like small cuts, a lot of cuts off. There are a lot of this on that particular one on the particular personnel issues. But clearly we have a different outcome than all of the potential that we saw in the pre-election period. There have been big reactions and there's been profiteking on various reactions. You know, we would still think that deregulation beneficiaries, there's going to be a flurry of activity from the new president regarding executive orders that will affect industries. The ability to build natural gas pipelines, natural gas exports, just simply not increasing the burden on the financial system. Again, these are things that are going to happen anyway. It's not going to change the directory of U.S. growth. We've seen a sharp pickup in small business sentiment. And of course, on the negative side, there is great tariff uncertainty. And of course, the scope for the headlines over tariffs is a lot bigger than what we think the reality will be. But these are... Let me interrupt you. You're trying to be a rational voice. Over the last few years, we've seen that DC isn't necessarily rational. I want to ask you about another factor that isn't an issue right now, but maybe coming up, the credit of the United States of America. If I remember back in August of 2023, fish downgraded the U.S. credit rating. And here was their rationale, at least in part, a high and growing general government debt burden, which remains the same. And the erosion of governance related to AA and AAA rated peers that has manifested in repeat debt limit standoffs and last-minute resolutions. That seems like a very similar picture to what we're seeing right now in DC. Should we be concerned about the credit rating of the U.S. being downgraded or a spike in bond yields if that's even something that someone these rating agencies even signal could happen? Well, look, there are many different roads to higher and lower interest rates. And the Federal Reserve easing monetary policy, right? Making it just somewhat more accommodative to higher inflation is the way that you get a steeper yield curve, not a credit-risk premium situation for the United States. We have a lower budget deficit that we did during the pandemic period. I think that we learned a lot from the pandemic period that the economy is not limitless in terms of how much fiscal stimulus can stoke inflation. And you can see plenty of other stories in the world where this is not the primary driver of volumes. Japan has doubled its debt relative to the GDP compared to the United States. At a lower interest rate than we then we've borrowed at for the last 40 years. But the Federal Reserve is seeing budget deficits. So there's been a lot of concern about this thing. It's been intermittent. And look, the risk of not increasing the debt ceiling at some green limit can be a worry that can trickle into markets. But I think we learned a lot from the prior decade and see that the political process is ugly as it seems, as crazy as it may seem at times. Really isn't the major problem for more. I want to finish on the markets very quickly, Stephen. We're almost out of time. But you're very bullish on small caps right now. We're going to show a chart right here. Rates and small caps. You can see they just move inversely. I know you don't seem to be that worried about a rise in bond yields. But the fact that bond yields have been elevated above 4.5%. They seem pretty sticky above that level. And also a lot of the Trump era, Trump policies could be inflationary and lead to a rise in bond yields. Look at this chart. I don't know if you can see it too, but they're certainly moving inversely. Doesn't that make you concerned about the small cap trade? I mean, doesn't that seem to have unwound a bit, especially with the Fed signaling fewer cuts? Oh, sure. The first of all, we want to be careful to quite discriminating about small caps. You take a look at small cap growth companies that are already profitable. They're trading well below their long-term average valuation, complete contrast to large caps. These are not again the leverage companies, right? That really constitute where the unprofitable companies that are in the Russell 2000. You could take a look to S&P indices, the full hundred and six hundred, for example, and try to take a look at growth companies. Again, these may be lower beta companies, but we think that they're undervalued. And then the final point is that why interest rates will rise? We're expecting uninterrupted economic growth, barring any shocks through 2026. If that's the case, the steepening of the yield curve that we get from Fed using is generally being driven by growth expectations and a recovery and profits for smaller mid-calf companies. That's what's really key. Stephen, why don't we go to leave it there? Always great to see you. Thank you very much. Have a great day. All right, on deck here at World Wide Exchange, no mean madness here. While one research shop is looking at fundamentals and it's chewy upgrade. We have your morning call sheet coming up right after this. Stay with us. Walk back to World Wide Exchange. Time now for your morning call sheet. Jeffries is upgrading Las Vegas Sands to a buy, raising its price started to $69. It says upgrades to casinos and Macau should benefit earnings growth and potentially lead to higher stock buybacks. Wolf is upgrading to outperform with a $42 price target right now. We're talking about chewy, also naming it a top pick for 2025. It sees upside to revenue and margin estimates and views valuation at 17 times EBITDA. That's highly reasonable. Raymond James is also upgrading block to outperform from market performance. It believes growth can accelerate back into double digits this year. And the valuation is attractive despite the stock's recent run. A more than 30% over the last three months. Time now for your global briefing. South Korea officials halting an effort to arrest and peach president Yoon after an hours long standoff at his residence. About 2700 law enforcement officials went to Yoon's home to serve in a rest warrant that is valid until Monday. Here right now we're taking a look at a lot of pictures outside the president's residence in Seoul. The move coming just one month after Yoon shocked the country and its allies by declaring martial law only to lift it about six hours later. It's unclear if the agency leading the arrest efforts will make another attempt over the weekend. Turning to markets in China, closing in the Red Forest Second Straight Day to kick off the new year. The mainland index closing out its worst weeks since back in 2022. Bonyls also hitting record lows. This after the FT reported the country's central bank has planning to cut its key interest rate at a quote appropriate time this year, adding officials in the country plan to expand issuance of ultra long bonds and will ramp up efforts to boost consumption in months ahead, including smartphone subsidies. All right, sticking with China. It is ramping up efforts to protect national security interests and what's been a month long tip for tax trade with the United States. Are you and us you and joins us now from Beijing with more in that story. Eunice, good morning. Hey, Frank. Well, it looks as though China aims to keep its EV technology in house. The Commerce Ministry said that it's revising its export controls to include technologies that are important to the production of EV batteries. This includes lithium and gallium extraction and refining and battery compounds and processing that are important for the battery performance. Now, the regulations we don't know when they're going to actually come into effect, but the public commentary period ends on February 1st. Now, the backdrop, of course, is that China is the world's largest producer of EV batteries. It's supplier's partner with both Chinese names such as the Nios and the X-Pangs, but also with international names like Tesla and Ford. And the battery supply chain is dominated by these Chinese players. And of course, people see this move as one for the Chinese to maintain that edge. The big question though, Frank, has been, what does this really mean for Chinese suppliers themselves that are looking to invest in other countries such as the United States? C-A-T-L, for example, as a big partner for Tesla. And then Goshen also has been looking to expand beyond Michigan. All right, Yunus Hune, live in Beijing. Yunus, thank you very much. Coming up here in World Wide Exchange, Sunday marks one year since the Alaska Airlines door plug incident that has resulted in a very costly year for Boeing and Ford shareholders. Up next, the executive take and what if anything can fuel a turnaround in the company and in the stock? We're back right after this. Stay with us. Welcome back to World Wide Exchange. Sunday marks one year since the mid-air blowout of a door panel on an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max Jet. That was the first in a series of negative events for Boeing last year, including the FAA putting a cap on production of the Max quality control issues, the exit of CEO Dave Calhoun. And there was a seven week strike by the machine issue and so a long list of issues there. Boeing stocks up about 25% since the end of the strike back in November. But it was so the worst performance in the Dow last year down 32%. Joining me now is David Bamiller, president of the Falcon Group and the former CEO of Pan Am, Sun Country and Aloha Airlines. David, good morning. Great to have you here. Hey, don't Frank happy new year. We hope we hope it's good for Boeing. I'm glad that you're starting the year of Glass half full, David. We are very old. So I'm an airline guy. You're an airline. That's the only week. That means you got to keep it steady, right? You got to always keep the plane steady. But on a series, when a serious no David, let's get down to business one year since that door plug blow out in your mind. As you look at this company, you've led other airlines. Have you seen clear signs of a turnaround here? To soon way to soon. It's like trying to steal an oil tanker. It takes a long time to do that. I think they brought in the right guy. They furloughed and got rid of a lot of talent over the past number of years. They did too much cross cutting. They changed the strategies. Oh, people noticed the last 10 or 15 years with Donald Douglas. And now this new guy coming in has a good record with the, I guess it was United Technologies and Rockwell Collins. His name. I'm just checking here. Yeah, it is Kelly or bird. Or bird. I don't know him personally, but I've studied his background. I talked to some of his people. He's got a great record. He's a walk around engineer. He's a guy that will be down on the floor talking to people, motivating the people. We're organizing middle and senior management, but it's going to take a long time. Do not expect to fix tomorrow morning. Not going to happen. So David, you're talking about the company as a former CEO. You've had to deal with the board. You've had to deal with investors. What about this stock? I'm looking at the chart. Bowling's all time high was about 440 hit back in March of 2019. Right now it's turning at about 171. It bounced about 25% would seem to be off of a low after the strike. We just mentioned it rising 25% since the strike. What do you think investors need to see to have more confidence in this company? Well, the order book is what 19,000 airplanes back log between them and Airbus. So in terms of production itself and demand, you know, the old supply and demand. The demand is very strong for their product regardless of all of these incidents. The issue is going to be getting the leadership focused on quality, which will give investors confidence for the long term. This is not a short term stock play in my opinion. It's a long term play. Bowling's going to be around. They're going to turn around. Their numbers are going to get better. They've got to improve their cash flow. But their order book is terrific. They still have in the industry a good reputation. David, can I ask you do you own any Boeing stock? No, I don't. All right. But it's outside looking in. You didn't one time, but it's outside looking at you saying it's a long term investor story right now. But do you still believe it's a solid company? Yes. Now I'm prejudice. I've always been a Boeing guy. I put a lot of Boeing airplanes in my day. And I've always said to them to Airbus. And I know a lot about the company and its possibilities. All right. David Bamelo, we got to leave the conversation there. You just keep that sunny outlook for 2025. We need more of that in the world. Yes. Duns on my shoulder. Good to see you. Thank you again. All right. Coming up here in Worldwide Exchange. Why Stephanie Lynx word the day is also her stock strategy for the year ahead. We'll be right back after this break. We'll walk back to Worldwide Exchange. We closed in on the 6 AM hour. A check of few big stories that were following this morning. So, all right. Looking at shares of US steel. They are sinking out of the opening. It's either down more than 8 and a half percent on reports that President Biden has decided to block New Pond's skills. Proposed $15 billion takeover and an official announcement it could come as soon as today. Meta platforms has also shaken up its policy team naming former Republican staffer and current vice president of policy Joe Kaplan as its new global head of policy. Also, we're looking at shares of Kervana. They are sharply lower in the pre-market. You can see they're down more than 3 and a half percent after closing down about 2 percent yesterday. This is after short seller Hindenburg research disclosed a new short position in the company again shares right now down 3 and a half percent for the week down of just about 10 percent. We're also looking at shares of Tesla rebounding after their Thursday slide. Tesla is currently riding a five session losing streak shares of Tesla down more than 11 percent for the week again. Rebounding a bit right now in the pre-market up almost 1 percent. So, stocks are getting off to a bit of a gloomy start in 2025 with the S&P 500 extending its losing streak to five straight sessions. But don't look too much into how the rest of the year could go based on the first trading day of 2025. Historically, the S&P has lost ground on the first day of the trading in the past two years only to go on to post gains of more than 20 percent overall. Joining me now is Stephanie Link, Chief Investment Strategist and Portfolio Manager at Hightower. She is also a CNBC contributor. Steph, happy New Year. Good morning. Happy New Year. Good morning. So, what do you make of that? We just hit you with the historical stat right there. S&P's closed lower on the first trading day last two years. We get the 20 percent gains. Do you see that happening again this year considering the slide that we've had going into the New Year S&P down about 3 percent over the last month? Well, I think, Frank, the setup for 2025 is a little more challenging because this year we're going to have less stimulus from the fiscal side of the equation. We're going to still have Trump's pro-growth policies, but if you add it all up, I don't think you're going to see 3, 3.5 percent GDP growth, which is what we saw last year and the year before, which has led to higher earnings and therefore the 20 percent plus gains in the market. I still think you're going to see mid-single digits, maybe upper single digit earnings growth, and that's good enough for the markets, but is it good enough for 20 percent gains? I'm not so sure. All right. Let's talk about tech a bit. If you look in this last month, I'm just using that as kind of just a way to look at the weakness that we've seen going into the New Year. Max, 7 up 3 percent, as I mentioned, the S&P down 3 percent in your mind. Despite all the concentration, the market is very concentrated. Would you just stick with that, Max, 7 mega-cap tech trade? Or do you believe that there is a broadening story that's going to unfold as we go into the New Year? I don't think it has to be one or the other, Frank, but I'm not entirely convinced that the Max 7 is going to lead us into 2025. They've had a nice run. I think the reason why in December they did so well is because people were chasing for performance because a lot of PMs were under their benchmarks. So they were chasing the winners, and those have been the winners here today. So I think you can own a few Amazon's, my largest position, but it's my only Max 7. I think there are other places in technology that are attractive, like Accenture and IBM and CrowdStrike, Zscaler. So there's plenty of places to choose from within tech, but I think you also want to look at some of the laggers, like you want to look at Energy. SLB, for example, down 25 percent last year. That's tremendous, right? And healthcare. No, that's really out of favor. I like Lily down about 18 percent. So I can find a lot of different names. I think this year might be a little bit more of a stockpickers market. You know, to your point, we are seeing a change of leadership energy, the best pouring sector over the last week. I want to get to your pick now. You gave us some names, but I want to get to your pick for today. What is your pick and why? My pick for today is the gap in consumer discretionary. The gap is this is the ultimate turnaround story led by Richard Dixon. Richard Dixon was at Mattel, and he, and he fixed Barbie when Barbie was broken. He has been there for about a year and a half at the gap.
