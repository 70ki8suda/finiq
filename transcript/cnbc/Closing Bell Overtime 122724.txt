 It's CNBC's big January with CES from Las Vegas, biotech and pharma at JPM health care, the World Economic Forum in Davos, and the first Fed decision of the year. Start the year ahead of the game, CNBC. This is the last scorecard on Wall Street, but the action is just getting started. Welcome to Closing Bell Over Time. I am Frank Holland with Leslie Picker, John and Morgan. They're off to that. I had this sour Goldman's tech playbook, analyst Eric Sheridan joins us with his top picks in tech as the Nasdaq sees a sharp pullback and the week. Plus, Elon Musk biographer Walter Isaac Sin will be with us to talk about the growing rift in the Trump orbit surrounding H1V visa. And former Fed economist, Sam, Claudia Sam will discuss her outlook for the Fed in a wild card factor that could throw its rate path into question. Let's begin though with this very active market today, joining us, Scott Ren of Wells Fargo Investment Institute and Brenda Vengello of Sandhub Global Advisors and CNBC contributor. Thank you both for joining us. Scott, let's start with you. We've got a vent rating, but still a significant sell-off to end the week today. No major catalyst, but do you think the sourd sentiment continues into next week for the end of the year? Well, you know, to be honest with you, let's like, we kind of wish it would because we're trying to be patient here. We could take another step toward cyclical risk and just stock risk if we felt like we had a halfway decent pullback, you know, 7%, 10%, total, something like that. Which, you know, if you look at the charts right now, somewhere in the 57, 50 range would be good support there. So, you know, if you get a pullback there, I think we'd be more interested here. In the meantime, we're trying to be patient. And I think anytime there's confusion with the Fed is inflation going to go up? Is it going to go down? Are they going to hike more? Are they going to hike less? That's the kind of volatility that can help investors. They have a decent feel for the economy going forward. If you get some downside and you think the economy is going to be pretty good, you know, you want to step in there and buy. So, that's what we're trying to do. And I think we're going to certainly be in for some volatility here over the next few months. Brenda, it feels like uncertainty with the path of monetary policy has been the narrative for the last few years now. What is your read on the economy? And how is it affecting the way that you're balancing your portfolio right now? Well, I think the economy is still very healthy. And that's the good news. So, healthy economy, healthy corporate earning story. But I think we look at valuation. It's starting to get to that stretched level. So, I think it's something to pay attention to. It's not an end all be all. But I think it does mean in our view that the market could be more susceptible to volatility. So, agree with Scott that as we head into next year, I think we could be in for a year of more volatility, particularly around policy with this new administration. There are still a lot of questions. Things could have worked out beautifully or they couldn't. So, we just don't know that right now. Certainly, but certainly watching for anything that would impact the corporate earning story to the positive or negative and same thing on the economy. But overall, we think it makes sense to maintain exposure to equity. But in our portfolios, we have been trimming some exposure to large cap stocks, just given the decent run that they've had this year. Recently added the Equal Weight S&P 500 vehicle, which hasn't acted very well, but we think it's a good setup heading into next year when we think there should be more broadening in the overall market. Brennan, if you don't mind, I'm going to stick with you for a second. I want to talk about tech. The Mag 7 mega cap tech really leading the declines today. Again, low volume trading, we know that it's a holiday week and all that. But is there anything we can take away from the action that we saw today? I think if you look at some of the larger names, like an apple, for example, it's all the way back up to 30 times forward earnings. So it's expensive. And yes, there's a great story there unfolding with a replacement cycle. We think though that that could be a little bit more prolonged and not happen all at once because of the gradual rollout of the AI products. But I think just in general, there's a lot of good news baked in to the mega cap tech stocks. And they have acted well over the last month, even though a lot of other sectors have not. So I do think that this is probably potentially some profit taking, which we would agree with at this stage. And we think we could see even more of that as we head into next year. If people are waiting for the new year to realize gains, but we think it makes sense to probably realize some gains this year as well. And to get ahead of that, because I think there could be more volatility in the first couple of weeks of the year as a result. It's always smart to take some profits, especially at the end of the year. Scott, I want to come back over to you. I know you're watching the dollar something we talked about here in this show yesterday. I've talked about on some other shows as well as rising more than four percent since the election. As you look into next year, how big of a concern is the dollar when we talk about Q4 earnings that obviously get reported next year. But also this broadening out story that so many people continue to talk about. I mean, the strong dollar doesn't that hurt the broadening out story? Well, it could, especially certainly if you have, if you have some international exposure. So I think the dollar is going to be strong because really, you know, Frank, if you look at the European economy, you look at the Japanese economy. You know, you look at what the Federal Reserve is doing with interest rates, which is, you know, we've only got one more cut price then between now and the end of 2025. So I think monetary policy, economic growth, there's a lot of things that favor the US dollar. Now do we expect it to, you know, scream higher from here? I don't think so. But the dollar, there's really in our minds, you know, there's no reason to think that we're going to have a weaker dollar, at least a significantly weaker dollar than what we're looking at right now through a year in 2025. So strong dollar, it can be painful, but I don't think we're going to get to the levels where the market really panics over a strong dollar. All right, look at the dollar chart right now. You're a data more than 6%. It's gotten brand new. Great to see you both. Have a great weekend. Happy New Year, guys. Let's talk more about today's tech sell off the NASDAQ falling one and a half percent and giving up a big chunk of its gains for the week. Joining us now is Eric Sheridan, managing director at Goldman Sachs. Eric, good to see you. All right, let's dig into this tech sell off. I mean, what do you think happened today? Again, we're going to continue to say it's throughout the show. It's a low volume day. It's a holiday week. Whether you think it's Algos or real traders, what do you think led to this action? It's kind of got a multiple choice for you. Is it the strong dollar? Is it fed uncertainty? Is it high valuations in the market, finally getting some religion when it comes to those valuations? I think it's a little bit of all the above. It's a thin market volume at the end of the year, the week between Christmas and New Year's is historically highly volatile on low volume. But it has been a very good year for tech, even in our preview for 2025. We pointed people towards names that we hadn't in a while. Names like Uber that had underperformed more recently in the last one to two months as both to the names that are exiting the year at 52 week highs. We are starting 2025 in a strong and demand environment that typically is good for tech when demand is good, but interest rates are volatile. FX and currency translation is likely to be a headwind in the way companies talk about Q1 guidance. So you could see heightened volatility to start the year and we would maybe shift a little bit to some of the names that are less at the top of the mind among the largest cap names in the group and look at some of the smaller mid cap names or even a name like Uber. So Eric, you brought it up. That's your top pick for 2025. It's Uber. I have a lot of questions about this being your top pick. So if you look at the chart, it's basically flat since the feds hawkish cut. So a small sample size, but at the same time, it's a very inflation sensitive company. It's also a disruptive company that might be getting disrupted by autonomous driving. I mean, why would that be your top pick when we continue to talk about the growth of AI going into next year? He has going to enable it that autonomous driving. Why Uber? Well, I always try to pick something that's a little bit contrarium at the end of every year. A year ago was Amazon and there were fears about Asia e-commerce into the West and how AI would impact AWS and you saw how Amazon performed in the last 12 months. Right now, Uber is weighed down by a handful of debates. As you pointed out, autonomous vehicles. We think that is a potential risk factor, the one that will play out of our very long duration, a period of time. And over the next one to two years, the vast majority of autonomous vehicle supply has nowhere near the unit economics to go direct to consumer in most markets and will end up as supply or choice for you inside the Uber app. We acknowledge their lapping inflation and pricing, but in the trends we can see through Q4. We actually think the company is well on track for hitting or exceeding the themes and the targets they laid out at their investor day just this past February. It's outsized growth and it's re-rated down to a lower value on gap earnings looking out to 2025 and 2026 that makes it quite compelling here. What is the market need to see, however, because they look at the street, 88% of analysts are recommending this stock by our overweight rating, but the shares this year are flat over the last six months, they're down 13%. So why do you see that disconnect, especially your point is that it's one of the few value plays in big tech right now. I would say number one, Leslie, it's results. You need to see results. There's fear about volumes on the mobility side. People are taking a small sample size of what's happening with Waymo and San Francisco and extrapolating that out as if that's going to be the normative fact pattern for the rest of the world. That's going to play out on our very long periods of time. We still think San Francisco isn't exactly what we would take away as an indicative exhibit. So we look at results in February, we look at the companies actions potentially on returning more capital shareholders. And by the way, there are no questions about their delivery business where we're seeing quite high and demand and we highlighted in our year ahead piece that local commerce broadly defined as things delivered to you. Same day and within a few hours feeds well into these food delivery businesses, morphing into wider local commerce platforms that doid ashes, the Uber eats and the insincords of the world. We think that's a theme that's underappreciated and undervalued right now inside Uber as well away from the mobility business. Well, in last year's e-commerce play, Amazon at 47%. So your 2024 pick certainly paid off. We'll see if Uber is the same way Eric shared and thank you very much for joining us today. Happy holidays, thanks. Happy holidays. When we come back former Fed economist Claudia, Sam joins us with her outlook for the Fed rates and the economy in 2025. And how AI-driven productivity could complicate the Fed's plans. And then later there's some growing tension between Elon Musk and others and President-elect Trump's orbits surrounding Bees' perform workers must biographer Walter Isaacson. He's going to join us to discuss this emerging rift in Washington. Over time, we're back in two minutes. It's CNBC's big January with CES from Las Vegas, Viotech and Farma at JPM Healthcare, the World Economic Forum in Davos and the first Fed decision of the year. Start the year ahead of the game. CNBC. Welcome back to Over Time. The New Year could present a major new challenge for the Fed. How to navigate a productivity boom without sparking a new bout of inflation. Steve Leesman joins us now with a closer look at the Fed's productivity problem. Steve. Hey Frank, thanks. Yeah, the US has experienced a productivity boom, which is really a good thing, but it also presents Fed Chair Jay Powell and the Fed with one of its great challenges for 2025 and how do you steer monetary policy through it. Productivity is averaged 2.6% over the past six quarters. That's a turnaround from negative numbers that followed the pandemic. It averaged just 1.5% from the great financial crisis to the pandemic. And this is likely before any AI impact comes into the picture here, even a full or a half a point extra productivity growth. That's a big deal raising how fast the economy can grow without sparking inflation. Investors, they got to figure out how to invest in it. The Fed has to figure out if it's real well back in 1996, same problem for Fed Chair Alan Greenspan. He famously saw productivity even when it wasn't obvious in the data with the economy running hot and threatening inflation. Greenspan held the line on interest rates even while colleagues urged to hike. He was right that we did question the value of the stock market placed on that productivity. So the question for the Fed now is, is it a short term or lasting episode? Will AI Trump tax cuts and deregulation possibly push up productivity growth or could tariffs and possible deportations to rel it? And of course, had his monetary policy steer its way through it all. Higher productivity generally would mean public and let the economy run somewhat hotter like Greenspan did in the 90s, but it could also mean a higher terminal funds rate because demand for capital ends up being higher when investments have high rates of return and productivity. Yeah, definitely an impact on that neutral rate and sounds like it's a pretty fragile as well, especially when we don't really know the true source of it. Steve, thank you. For more than what's ahead for the Fed, let's bring in Claudia Som. She's the chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former economist at the Fed. Let's start there on productivity. Do you have any expectations for productivity and its impact on the economy right now? Right, well, I just want to underscore with Steve said having productivity boom that we've had recently. This is the best kind of problem the Fed could have to deal with because this is, you know, very good for the economy grows, you know, grows the buy faster. What it's the difficulty for the Fed is is trying to figure out of the growth we've had and we have been living through this the past two years we have had well above trend growth. And the Fed has had to try to navigate get how to get inflation down the same time we've seen disinflation. So a lot of that above trend growth we've had that was this supply that was this productivity. We also have had more workers come online. So the Fed does not need to fight that kind of growth. The Fed fights when demand driven growth gets out ahead of supply and they need to slow things down. But of course you can't look at a GDP number and have it tell you this is a demand part. This is a supply part and it's very important because monetary policy takes time to work as way through the system is how persistent do we think the czar. And frankly, at this point, and when you look at the Fed's projections, when you listen to them talk, most of them are taking a pretty cautious view of the productivity path going forward. And we really haven't seen a lot of officials taking on and saying, Hey, it's here to stay this productivity boom. We're going to build on it. So they don't have that optimism built in their forecast. But I think that's something they're going to obviously continue to watch. Well, as part of it to just understanding exactly what's causing the productivity boom to understand its resilience and the implications for monetary policy really kind of getting to the root of what's driving these buoyant numbers that we've seen. Right, absolutely. And really this productivity boom, the seeds of it appear to have been planted soon after the pandemic. And in all of the disruptions that were happening, we saw a burst of business applications business and which has held up over time, which researchers have carefully traced through other databases to see it's not just the applications. It's businesses starting is businesses starting with employers and we know that younger and more dynamic firms tend to get the productivity going. So that's been important. It took years to play that out. And then the other thing the United States has really stood out in this cycle since the pandemic is we have had a really dynamic labor market in that we moved a lot of workers to better and different jobs than they were before the pandemic. That was very disruptive. We can remember the labor shortages and how that was tough on on businesses and on some workers. But that really put people like matched workers up with jobs where they were more productive than before. And it gave businesses a big incentive to make some more capital investments to make the workers they had more productive. And so we're reaping the benefits of that, you know, now, but then the question is, can we hand the baton off to emergent technologies and further capital investments? And that's that's where there's a big question mark. And technically history is on the side of the productivity growth returning back down and more normal lower pace. So, Hey, Claudia. I want to come full circle. What does this all mean for the Fed long term? I mean, coming up on January 10th, we get the jobs report. But before that on the eighth, we get those Fed minutes. What are we expecting? Or what do you expect any hear from these fed officials about productivity about the incoming administration? I feel like J. Palis said, you know, Fed members at least acknowledge that some of these policies might take place in the impact that would have on the labor market on inflation and other parts of the economy. Very can see it's showing up in some of the Fed discussions this year are around with the neutral rate of interest is right. It's a structural parameter in the economy that gets saving and investment in alignment productivity potential output growth. These are integral leader considered to be things that would tie in like if the economy is just more productive. It's growing faster, but growing faster in a very sustainable way. But interest rates should be higher. That's a sign of a healthier economy. The Fed funds rates should be higher. That's what the account that you're not fighting inflation. You've just got a healthy economy with higher rates. So, but the thing that the Fed officials haven't done thus far is though they have been matching up their neutral rate of interest estimates. There are star estimates. We haven't really gotten a lot of dialogue on why. And they haven't moved their potential output estimates, which would typically be the median official hasn't moved them, which would typically be where that is. And J. Pal has been pretty allergic to going through and careful detail, you know, parsing out the neutral rate of interest. So I think they're going to have to have this conversation. And yes, I think the minutes are one place to be looking for this and definitely listening any time to get a Fed official like, Hey, you raised your neutral rate. Why? What's going on? What changed? See if it's productivity. Claudia, some really great to have you here. Thank you very much. Enjoy the weekend. Thank you to. Alright, coming up here in overtime, the holiday shopping rush. It may be over, but the headaches could just be starting for shipping companies as they face the possibility of a major port strike in just a few weeks. We're going to break down what's at stake. That's coming up next. And we'll talk to former target vice chairman Jerry storage about how a strike could impact retailers and which company is one in lost the Christmas season. It's CNBC's big January with CES from Las Vegas, biotech and pharma at JPM health care, the world economic forum in Davos and the first Fed decision of the year start the year ahead of the game CNBC. Welcome back to OT global shipping stocks. They're performing this week is the market appears to be increasing its bets that there will be a strike at the east and the Gulf ports, whether you believe it's Algo's or real traders. It's one thing we know for sure, the January 15 deadline for the port operators and longshoreman, a reach a deal is fast approaching. So this week, MSC and hotpot, Lloyd, two shipping giants, they announced, strike related search charges for shipments to the US. There will begin in January to cover additional expenses related to the strike and possible congestion container shipping rates from Asia to the US. They've already increased about 15% month to date. That is largely attributed to the shift by retailers and other importers away from the east and Gulf ports over to the West Coast ports to try to mitigate the impact of a possible strike. It's also setting up for what could be one of the biggest supply chain challenges since the pandemic, a possible strike at the east and Gulf ports on January the 15th. It's possible new tariffs on inauguration day and lunar new year earlier than normal. There is generally a freight surge in the week ahead. So the biggest retailers, they're often seen as the best position to deal with the prolonged strike with names like Walmart, Target and Costco, often getting priority from supply chain companies due to the size of their operations. So for more on how a port strike could impact retailers, let's bring in storage advisors, CEO Gerald Storch. He's also the former vice chairman of Target and the former CEO of Toys de Russ, Jerry. Happy holidays. Good to see you. Thank you. So you're having talking to some of the biggest logistics companies. They're telling me big retailers like a Walmart and a Costco. They're shifting over to the West Coast ports. They're also bringing things in early to try to mitigate a port strike. So when I ask you, besides their one or two week strike, when will we start to see the impact when it comes to these major retailers? What are the signs for investors that it's having a negative impact? Certainly, it's going to be a lower impact. Whatever happens, then it would have been last fall. This is a pretty low volume time of the year when you put it in perspective. And frankly, the retailers didn't do too well. They don't mind if it's a little bit too late because they might have too much inventory already. But the strong retailers, as you pointed out, they pulled forward inventory. They saw this coming months away and they shifted to other ports, other modes in some cases to air freight where that made more sense. So it really shouldn't be a drag on business right away. Hopefully the whole situation won't drag on too long. Obviously, it does cost will increase. And you'll have some shortages. There are things you just can't bring in early. The famous example of bananas, where how long can you store banana? And certainly there are problems for automobiles coming from Europe into the East Coast ports. So eventually it could become a problem. But smarter retailers don't just put this in its own category. They put together with look, look, the threat of wars, look what's going on in the Red Sea with the Houthis, tariffs and all the uncertainty that provides. The pandemic, you mentioned that earlier. So there are so many issues with supply chains that the old thinking that just in time was best has been thrown out the window and people are saying, let's build flexibility into our system. And that's what the best retires have already done. So they should be able to handle this unless it just drags on for a month or longer. All right. So you're saying that they're able to handle it logistically, but what about their financials? I mean, what about a margin impact? What about EPS impact? When we talk about shifting supply chains, that costs money when we talk about holding inventory longer by pulling ahead. That's a higher carrying costs. So how do you see that impact in these retailers when it comes to earnings after the holiday season? Well, you're right. It's something, but in the broader scheme of things, I just don't feel that it's a red. You know, it's a yellow type thing. You know, green, red, yellow red. This is yellow right now. It's not red. I think they have much bigger issues. The winners and the losers here in retail are pretty stark. And if people are winning or winning by so much, and if people that are losing are losing by so much that they're still going to be winners and losers. Jerry, one of my favorite stats of the day was from bespoke where they said that the most correlated stock to Apple and the S&P 500 over the last year has been TJX. And I wonder what you think that says about the state of retail right now. Look, there are some, you know, people say, Oh, the consumer had a good holiday. OK, you know, all boats did not float for over a year now. I've been recommending four companies is being best on strategy and best run. They're Walmart, TJX, which you just mentioned, Costco and Amazon. And they have just done phenomenally, both in the stock market and in terms of gaining market share. And frankly, I think that's what's going to continue. Retail isn't changed that fast. The consumer doesn't change that fast. They love those companies just as much as they hate some of the more traditional retailers like department stores or some of the aging apparel chains. So is the fate of department stores just over? Can they turn it around? I mean, this has been a year of many headlines in the department store world. Macy's closing stores amidst activist pressure. You've got Nordstrom family taking the company private again. I mean, is there a light at the end of the tunnel here? Is the business model just over? Well, the way they're running it right now, I don't think it's going to work to change just as significant enough to resonate with consumers, particularly younger consumers. Look, your mother or your grandmother may still love stopping at department stores, but you don't and your children won't. And you know, that's what's going on right now. It's almost a generational shift to change it. They have to totally change how they do business become a much more desired place to shop. And you know, people may say, Oh, look Walmart and Costco, those stocks are way the heck up. I can't buy those. Would you rather buy the stock of a company that's married in strategic disarray and operational weakness? I don't think that's a very good bet either. So I think there's a tough road to ho for the retailers that have been losing share. And I wouldn't put my money with any of them, whether it's Costco or I'm sorry, whether it's Coles, Costco I love, whether it's a Coles or whether or not it's Macy's, whether it's anyone in that bracket. Yeah, I'm going to some Costco sells country in Western gear. I know that's your jam, Jerry, but on a serious now, I want to ask you about something I've been hearing kind of bubbling up gift cards shorter holiday season this year. A lot more people turning to gift cards to give their gifts as opposed to actual physical gifts. How does that play out when we look at the next quarters and this quarter, because in this quarter, these gift cards when they're purchased their liability, they're not really realized until me and you actually use them. How do you see that whole narrative playing out? As a retail CEO, I love it when the consumer buys gift cards instead of instead of a physical item. There's no return. I mean returns are a mess. You've heard about that. You've read about that. Let me tell you it's more than true. You don't want to be dealing with returns this week. So no one returns gift cards. They're fantastic. And it's almost like, you know, the gift giver is doing our job for us. They're giving their their friend or their loved one a gift card that the only way I can be redeemed is if the person receives it goes to the store, goes to the website. So they're marketing for us. And then there's always a couple of percent, say around 3% on average, where they never spend it at all. And that just goes straight to the bottom line. So we love it when people give gift cards. It's advertising for the retailer for the future. I feel like I'm in that 3% because I always wait for that perfect item and then it never comes up and then it just sits in my drawer for I get lost or anyway, Jerry storage. Thanks so much. Happy holidays to you. My pleasure. Thanks, Docs, pulling back today, but still pacing for a banner year in 2025 could bring a wave of consolidation under Trump 2.0. We'll look at which name stand to benefit and why MNA doesn't always lead to shareholder gains. And then later why 2025 could be another breakout year for crypto, even as Bitcoin, it retreats further back from the 100,000 mark right now trading in about 94,580 overtime will be right back after this. And welcome back to overtime time for a CNBC news update with Kate Rooney. Kate, hey there Frank Starbucks lost most of an appeal to overturn an LRB decision that the company illegally fired to Philadelphia, baristas who wanted to organize a union. A federal appeals court said the National Labor Relations Board had substantial evidence to support its argument that Starbucks engaged in unfair labor practices, but the court also said the agency. When beyond its authority by ordering Starbucks to pay the baristas expenses, meanwhile the U.S. is expected to announce on Monday that it will send 1.25 billion dollars in military aid to Ukraine officials. Tell the Associated Press the package includes surface to air munitions as well as stinger missiles and artillery rounds it's part of a Biden administration push to give Ukraine as much aid as possible before President-elect Trump is inaugurated next month. And a 9th U.S. telecoms firm has been hacked by a massive Chinese espionage campaign known as Salt Typhoon. Deputy National Security Advisor Ann Newberger said the unnamed company was added to the list after the government released guidance on how to detect hackers in their network. So guys back over to you. Thank you so much. The banking bulls see the prospect of consolidation as giving a boost to the banking sector in 2025. Over the past few quarters we've seen a rebound in activity with U.S. banks notching $14 billion worth of mergers this year, surpassing 2022 and 2023 levels. But the question is whether that momentum continues or even accelerates into the new year. And as maybe emboldened by the recent performance of their peers that have made acquisitions as KVW pointed out in a recent note, examples they cite include old national bank, South State and UMB. KVW also recommends buying shares of potential acquirers such as cadence bank, citizens first bank, prosperity and Tomkens. PNC CEO William Demchack has been outspoken about M&A plans for banks with strong core retail deposits in what he calls desirable markets. Washington also seems to be amenable. The House Financial Services Committee recently proposed measures that would reduce obstacles for community bank mergers and revisit the way regulators evaluate bank deals. This is the vision of representative French Hill, a former bank CEO who was recently named the next chair of that committee. But the flip side to deregulation is it may bring down the cost of compliance, which could make skill less of a necessity. And the banking industry may opt to use that extra capital for digitizing operations that expand and keep abilities instead of buying targets. Additionally, 2024 saw a cautionary tale of bank M&A with New York Community Bank, which had been bulking up through acquisitions of Flagsthar and signature to name a few. And those acquisitions pushed it above $100 billion in assets threshold, which meant stricter capital rules that it was ultimately unprepared for as its commercial real estate book, Sourd Frank. We saw that story take place this year. It's lost 71% of its value year to date, largely due to some of these issues. Yeah, quite the chart there. I think after SVV we thought a lot of this disruption in the banking sector was over, but I mean, look at a chart like this, you can see it not quite. Yeah, I mean, it was kind of an idiosyncratic situation. We didn't see too many others like that this year, but certainly one telltale sign that sometimes bulking up and becoming bigger may create more problems than it does benefits. All right, very interesting, Marath, Leslie. Thank you. All right, after the break, or cracks are in the form of the Musk Maga Alliance, Elon Musk, a photographer, Walter Isaacson joins us. He's coming up next to talk about that rift surrounding H1B visas. A lot of talk about there. Stay with us. Potential cracks forming in the relationship between Elon Musk and President-elect Trump's base around foreign worker visas called H1Bs. Musk, Vivek, Ramaswami and some other Trump appointees have been arguing in favor of expanding visas for highly skilled workers. Musk tweeting, in part, if you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will lose. While some of Trump's core Maga supporters like Ann Kultur saying American workers can leave a company if they want to, an H1B workers cannot comparing them to indentured servants for big tech companies. So what comes next for the Musk Maga Alliance joining us now is Walter Isaacson. He is an advisory partner at Perallo Weinberg. History professor at Tulane and distinguished fellow at the Aspen Institute is also a CMBC contributor and author of the book Elon Musk. Thank you very much, Walter, for being here. It's been a year since I have read this book, but I'm just curious from your vantage point, where do you think the Venn diagram is? At least the overlap in the Venn diagram between the Musk side of the tech billionaires and tech executives that have this way of thinking, and then the America first base, which is against this type of immigration. It's probably the most interesting discussion you could have now, and it's not just some food fight happening on X. It's a fundamental question about the economy. And in some ways, a CMBC viewers will probably understand, definitely will understand it better than some Americans, which is that when you bring in really good workers from whether it be Indian, China, or for that matter, Germany, or Senegal, and they're adding productivity to the economy, that does not mean there are fewer jobs for other people, for heritage Americans or whatever, because you grow the economy and you have more jobs. And so what we're seeing now is people who are in favor of growth and technology growth, and people for understandable reasons, who say, wait, wait, wait, we're going a little bit too fast here. We have to take care of America first, as the phrase goes. And it's going to be a tricky thing to resolve. As someone who knows musk well and has really studied his way of thinking, is he someone who would capitulate on issues if it meant preserving this political power that he's been able to garner over the last year? Is this something we would see a 180 on if Trump said, hey, this is important to me. I in my base. Compitulation is not one of the top 10,000 adjectives you would ever put on Elon Musk, and he feels very strongly that you have to be hardcore all in when he took over Twitter. I remember those first three weeks there described in the book in which he said, okay, who's all in and who isn't now as you know, and culture and others may have said, if you have an H1B visa, you're more likely to want to be all in the world. So it is as Vivek Ramaswamy said to some extent a cultural issue, are you the type of person who really wants to be all in? Those are the type of people must think we need to have. He's not in to work life balance or B plus students just making it along. I'm trying to go along. I think he's going to push very hard for hardcore all in whether be federal government or H1B visas in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. Hey, well, there's this Frank Holland good to see you again. Happy holidays. He Frank. How are you? So I want to ask you, I read your book. You and I talked right after you released the book in the book. I don't want to get too into the book, but you kind of describe Elon Musk as being a bit erratic and so did his friends. Is he definitely pro USA? I know he's a citizen now, but is he definitely pro USA or is he pro maga when we come to issues like this? Are we going to see him lean more towards the president or is he more pro USA in your mind? I think what you're seeing with this dispute Frank is him pushing the pro USA side. In other words, pushing back against the maga people who are not only against illegal immigration, but against many forms of immigration. And he feels that if America is going to compete with China or compete in the world, it needs to have the best engineers, the best thinkers, the best doers, the hardest core workers in the world. And that's what's causing this with with a maga base that is a little bit nativist to some extent against different diverse cultures coming here. And to some extent wants to protect an American way of life, which as Vivek Ramaswami said includes loving sports or cheerleading or whatever. I think Musk is all in on growth and productivity in the US. So given all of that, are you going to write a Musk biography part two? And if so, do you have any predictions on how it would conclude as it pertains to Musk's relationship with Trump? Not right now. I think all you need to know about Musk is in that book, including the hard core, including what he did when he came into Twitter, which will be what he does when he comes in to the United States. I think in five or six years, there may be another book to be done, but right now, I think you got all you need. All right, Walter Aziz, and we got to leave the conversation there. Great to see you. Thank you very much. And remember, we still got to get that cheese date Walter. We got to talk about that. I know we got to. All right, have a great weekend. Oh, you got to come down to New Orleans here and we can give you a public. So that wasn't a hard sell there. Walter Aziz and great to see you. Thank you very much. All right, still hitting on overtime, Bitcoin and crypto related stocks pulling back hard in today's sell off, but still up significantly since the election. We're going to talk to one expert about why he says crypto was entering a new phase of maturity. Stay with us. And welcome back to overtime. We have a news alert out of Washington on TikTok. Megan Kasella has those details. Megan. Frank, we're starting to get some learning. We're starting to learn some of the arguments in this case about TikTok. That's before the Supreme Court. In its main brief before the Supreme Court, the Biden Justice Department led by Attorney General, Marik Garland is arguing that Chinese control of TikTok threatens national security and not letting a foreign adversary spread propaganda and collect data about its users. TikTok then countered with its own brief, arguing that a ban would be unconstitutional because it would threaten freedom of speech, stifling the speech of what it says are 170 million American users. And then we saw a third brief from President Trump arguing on behalf of President Trump and a third brief opposing a ban on TikTok saying that he wants to resolve the issues through political means once he takes office. He said he was not taking a position on the merits of the dispute in this brief, but that he wanted to pursue a negotiated resolution, one that would prevent a shutdown of the app, but still protect national security and guys remember that unless the Supreme Court makes a move here and decides to strike down this ban, this law would take effect on the public. On January 19th, the day just before President Trump is set to take office on January 20th. Such an evolving story, Megan Kassala. Thank you for staying all over it. Will 2025 be the year of Bitcoin, the CEO of crypto firm Bitcoin joins us to explain why he sees rocket fuel being added to the crypto rally under the second Trump administration. And welcome back to overtime. Bitcoin is falling today, but it's still a major win of this year, more than doubling in 2024 and crypto investors. They're very enthusiastic about 2025, expecting friendly policy from President elect Trump. Joining us now is Bicco CEO Mike Belchee. Bicco is a cryptocurrency trading and storage platform. Hey, great to see you, Mike. Hey, Frank, good to see you also. All right. So Mike, we're just talking about it just now. Bitcoin, huge run up year today, even bigger run up after the election. What's going to push this higher? What isn't already priced in? Actually, I think the regulatory is somewhat priced in, but in general, we've seen that these news events don't always price in until they're actually here. So look, we have a new administration coming in. Things look very promising. People are excited. They're very bullish, but it's not here yet. So actually, I think we're going to continue to see the effects of that all through 2025. Remember that for the last two and a half years, we've had not just a regulatory environment that didn't want to help you. We had a regulatory environment that was actively trying to kill you. So all of a sudden, with that changing in the opposite direction, we're going to continue to see good gains next year. All right. What about David Sacks? I was going to be the, you know, quote unquote, crypto czar. Do you think that's not priced in to some of these upside moves we've seen in crypto? I think it's indicative of what this administration is about. They want to see innovation happen. They want to see it happen here in America. They want to see America's strength. So, you know, David Sacks helping both on the AI side, as well as on the crypto side is phenomenal. He happens to be a big investor in Bicco. I've known David for 10 years, I think, at this point. So, look, he's a phenomenal mind. He's been seen all over the all in podcast for the last couple of years and people see exactly how capable this man is. So I think he's going to be a great help to the administration and he's going to miss. He's going to help make sure that the policies that they're looking for come through. Do you expect to see in 2025 more companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet? That obviously was a big theme of 2024. I'm curious if you think that continues and whether there's any kind of reputational risk that goes along with that size of purchase of Bitcoin. It's absolutely going to happen. We're talking with multiple clients right now about doing that. It's been a conversation for the last couple of years, but frankly, the regulatory changes make it a lot easier. Having ETFs available, make it a lot easier. People don't remember exactly how much balance sheet cash some of the largest top seven companies have. I mean, it's hundreds of billions of dollars. So having some access to Bitcoin into that portfolio, into that treasury management, just makes sense. And remember, it's a hedge against whether the US can curtail inflation. And while we're optimistic about what's going to happen with the new administration over the next few years, America has not had a track record at all of being able to curtail spending. So if we're going to continue to see monetary supply go up, Bitcoin is the perfect hedge against that. Is there a concentration risk though if companies do start to adopt this on mass? Some people talk about that from like would ETFs become mass accumulators of Bitcoin. I don't see that as a media problem at all. And I think we're going to see a mixture because we do talk with corporates, but a mixture of some taking self custody, others using different providers, and then using the ETFs. So I don't think it's a foreseeable problem. I mean, it could become a problem in the long term, but we'll see how that goes. So David, I mean, I mean, I think I mean, sorry Mike, I apologize. I was thinking about it. I'm sure you did it. It's right there because we want to make sure we had a disclosure that he's an investor's new yours, but you already did. I did it. I do want to ask you, what does Bitcoin actually use for? I asked a lot of people in my show worldwide exchange, what's the actual purpose of Bitcoin and people invest in it. They're very bullish on it, but overall is we're looking at 2025 and beyond. What's the purpose? Is it stored value? Is it quote unquote digital gold? Does it have some other purpose that's going to reveal itself later on? That's a great question. Like, I mean Bitcoin and
