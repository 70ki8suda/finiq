Mad money starts now Hey, I'm Kramer welcome to Mad money. Welcome to Kramer I got a little bit friends. I'm just trying to make some money my job is not just entertained but to educate teach you about all Crazy stuff that happens here. So call me 1007 for the PC PC. Tweety at Jim Kramer Have you noticed the extreme negative ECB in already even when the start bar was up nice to this morning for the midday Swoon the closed down finishing down 102 points. SB the climbing point to 2% now it's that closing point once incident All I heard was that well we've been up big for two straight years and we're due for a pullback or these are perilous times like the 1930s high tariffs collapse and real trade coming the 10-year treasury heading to 5% because of inflation Infect of fed or extended stocks So pull on its last legs Sure, sure I get it, but being a bear is easy in this business If stocks go up no one will remember your negative progocication right if stocks go down you'll be a seer We will sing your praises worship you you'll become the big get Printed out every time the market goes down big because you have street cred and you see that bear go Brrrr You know I love that thing anyway, you know me sure the day was disappointing kind of like last week But I want to tack the other way. I want to tell you what could go right give you 10 things that might cut in favor of the balls All right, they're not rip snores. No trampolars hair Just some things that will let say they make me want to be a little more positive than others I need to tell you what can go right because nobody else is Know what I like being alone some of the best moments of my vacation just that it were being alone Just kidding about that first the brimming of Biden's any trust regulators as the FTC and the Justice Department that will be fabulous Fabulous for the market the party of DC chief we had a con she seemed to despise every deal and truly upward all big business No matter how great it might have been for the economy or for you or for the average worker She is in the end way over her head her sponsor a case But then will raise the price of alcohol for everywhere if she wins perfect nice comment touch a real asset the president Biden With them that all the way we'll see a huge number of deals that will help rationalize entire industries allow smaller companies banking retail materials And if I saw for a farmer to compete against the big dogs Fantastic for the stock market just fantastic the end of Lena cons know nothing FTC is a welcome development another way You know we you know that we've had the developing shortage of equities We aren't getting any big IPOs at least not yet But if we do I am confident that M&A will take enough stock out of the market that will still have a shrinking share count Or is your member of the stock market is indeed a market and like any other market when there's not enough supply you get higher prices Third what happens if Trump's tariffs turn out to be negotiable What if they're more steak knife and less meat acts a smart non-smooth holy program won't be great for more trade But then again America elected a pro-tariff president if you own stocks you want them higher you have to hope for negotiable tariffs That could cause countries to lower prices to us or make multinational companies move their manufacturing base here to a friendly We're friendly country classic case Constellation brands okay, it's a let-out tariff policy would not force Medellin or Corona to be made in Toledo Ohio Fourth housing breaks price. We're already seeing what happens when there's over building us It's case in Florida prices come down when more your trades come up what happens prices go down once prices come down You know what buyers start staying away hoping for still lower prices and it usually works Causing sellers to panic furiously cutting prices and salads Less they'd be stocking can't move It's called the cycle although it hasn't operating normally for the last few years I think 2025 will be the year that the cycle research itself in the feb will win big on this one Big enough to be able to cut rate slowly but cutting nonetheless Which of course is what we need and that's why these home-building stocks keep coming down. It's way too early to bottom fish there Fifth we need to hope that Bobby Kennedy Jr. decides to go with the foods that are bad for us Post-the-vaccines that are good for you the makers of the jail p-1 weight loss drugs better have some pretty good data on hypertension cardiac indices It's just maybe dementia even cancer if they're going to get Kennedy on the other side Otherwise, he will just say no to one jaw no I just gonna call from that now. It was a thing. It's really funny Yes to diet and exercise. That's what he wants. I think it'll turn out the format Hit bottom ahead of the appointment taking effect Ah Mutton jaw no Sick oh come on. I have a case. I'm having a good time give me a break 20 years of this. Let me have some fun All right six potential positive we start seeing some real AI wins Not just small expense cuts because of it. Maybe we get some true data on how to stop cancer We create new devices that be hard to kill diseases. We learn to map the brain to solve the neurological problems We unlock health care's has never been because well we'll have modeled every major attempt to fix the body and how every protein reacts to it Seven AI gives us robots that our programs so well that they can do the work of five people Which could run a monster wave of wage inflation from Trump's proposed deportations robots will place people in restaurants retail home building Transportation they'll be unloading the trucks medicine insurance credit card call centers sounds harsh But Trump won the election running on a hard deportation policy assuming he pushes that through will you go have massive wage inflation or widespread Automation I prefer the latter eight president like Trump declares the federal interstate highway system a full self driving zone And he accepts data from Tesla that allows the company to jump way ahead of Waymo and become the national self driving core big win free You want a musk No, the federal government goes to Starlight gives the official internet system for the country and must combination satellite phone and internet services cost $60 a month big win for musk This starlink is amazing to have him try it. It's very tough to pet her Tenth we get used to stocks trading in the trillions. It's not an aberration anymore Right now there are way too many people who think it's really outrageous for so many comments We've valued over trillion dollars meta alpha bit Amazon Apple and Nvidia Microsoft Tesla the usual suspects These stocks could all have a big surge from here if we simply keep getting more money going into index funds That's what really helps to propel these not just the businesses themselves Even as the businesses are phenomenal and deserve the premium there you have it 10 potential pauses Of course, I could run a whole segment the way most people want to hear Trump's towers to bring this in place Which will close up a year on the tenure to go through five trillion worldwide depression like 1933 I could suggest the mass deportations will drive up wages to the point where the feb will have to raise Industries I could have said the mic seven are out of control and will become a huge source of funds. I pray seven lit. They lose Oh come on anyway, I know I could have said apple and video mic so full missed numbers That enterprise software will crater for competition that one of the auto companies go back But maybe I could just tell you the pound to get scutted half and Bitcoin goes down to $50,000 but the problem is Well, here's the bottom line. I don't believe those negatives will happen So if you excuse me. I don't want to offer Cassandra all what everyone else do that job. They are much better at being pessimistic than I am Let's go to James in my homestead New Jersey James Hey, Jim happy new year to you and the whole team over there. Oh, thank you James. Yep, and the group is so good here And you know there there everybody is good in 2025 as they were in 2024 and that is saying something All right, so listen I bought a stock a couple years ago planning to hold it for many many years Problem is it's run up so much on me. It's now 20% of the portfolio Can I stick to the plan and hold it or do I need to trim some meta right here? How much of a 20% okay, I'm what let's say you have 10 stocks. I'm okay with 20% I think that that's I think meta is an upstock. It's going higher I'm not going to tell you to sell it if it gets up to 30 at 25 30 I would tell you to cut back, but I think meta is okay for you Now for the child trust I wouldn't let anything go above 5% but I got a lot more stocks. I think that Metta's going higher. Let's go to Chris and Massachusetts Chris Hey, Jim Chris on math. How you doing? Love your show. Oh, thank you. Happy new year my friend. Happy new year right back at you. Thank you Let's talk jacking. I've been holding on to this thing since 2020 It seems they can't get out of their own way Jim Lotta lotta headwinds with this with this dog right lawsuit No inside inside of sales no purchases of 2024 Faith tax increases I mean California The text is going to come on board. It needs California, Texas. You just said it right I mean, it's in any time touchdown if you get it California, Texas right now It's kind of like a 14 parlay and you get the three right, but you never get the fourth. What can I say? That's how it feels and they do need those two states and then you'll be okay. Let's go to Keith and Florida. Please keep We are Jim We are so it's a Wall Street bet. What's your opinion on Robin Hood this year Robin Hood is another stock that I would tell you they've got to get a little more diversified their client base is really into crypto At options they need to do more than that That said they just lapping all the all the other brokers They understand what young people want and the other guys are run I don't know the other copies seem like run by guys like me that seem to be too old to understand I have like young and hard. I think what Robin Hood does is really really fabulous And the other guys should have been able to figure that out too and they just have it kind of embarrassing Look, I could be a negative Nellie or Nancy whatever about this year like the major averages were today But I need to tell you what I I think can actually go right because nobody else is doing it Oh man money tonight. I'm ringing the new year by By breaking down the biggest bidders and loses 20x4 starting with the Nasdaq 100 Thanking stocks like Walgreens and ST water craft they come back in the your head I'm looking closer to yes be 500 stocks that lead and lag the path and later I'm taking to the some dividend stocks that could buff up your portfolio and an uncertain market so stay with Cramer Don't miss a second of mad money follow at Jim Cramer on X have a question tweet Cramer hashtag mad mentions Send Jim an email to madmoney at cnbc.com or give us a call at 1-800-743-CNBC miss something head to madmoney.cnbc.com Global markets up to the minute front page news wake up to frank holland and worldwide exchange weekdays five a.m. Eastern CNBC live ambitiously We don't have many years like 2024 where everything seems so obvious and the obvious winners actually hit the jackpot But that's what happened last year if you try to get creative you try to get clever you missed out on some truly idiot proof winners The losers in the other hand well they were not as easy to spot because in many cases They were the markets formed with winners even if they'd long to go lost their way Like every year of mad money we throw what went right and what went wrong in the previous year By looking at the top five and bottom five first the Nasdaq 100 which outperform and then the sp 500 which finished slowly below It's more high-tech high-tech comment when we sit in our bullpen worthy on the show a bullpen that feels like some sort of old time sit calm We curse at certain stocks for how overly well they are knowing that one day There'll be a better mouse trap and you're wishing gotten off the spaceship for a crash and a burn last year that stock was app Alarvin The best performer in the Nasdaq which places ads in mobile video games among other tasks Of course they use AI and advanced algorithms and target their advertising of course they do a great job Of course there is none better until of course somebody else comes along with something cheaper stronger more powerful and more That's why 8% of the company shares are sold short people know that competition is inevitable honestly I think Google dominate this base in a heartbeat They won't worry about just partitating trust vision although those goods will soon be soon be brew I'm betting 2225 will be the year when venture capital is start funding proposal for app love and alternatives Which why I can't endorse this stock here at nearly 60 times this year's army's estimates But try telling that to the true believers you set it up 713 percent last year another 5% 5.5 and today which frankly I think I don't even take this I mean enough app love and already As for the second best performer, I honestly don't know why this micro strategy is allowed to exist I mean really here's a company that's making a leverage bit that on Bitcoin. That's what it is It's an investment company. I think it's a regular one. That's a software company But we're no world. Nobody cares to hear about any crypto regulation whatsoever Especially now right about to have like a real crypto friendly president And that's how it advanced 359 percent last year. We'll probably go up again Listen, I like Bitcoin. I own Bitcoin in part because I can't own stocks If you can't if you can own stocks and you believe in Bitcoin with oil your heart and soul then feel free to buy micro strategy It's Bitcoin on steroids but not that much more Most obvious winner for 2020 for Palantir the defense software company is trying to revolutionize the way the Pentagon works It's CEO Alice Park is a brilliant bad boy smash now Philly guy who's like a meter version of Elon Musk and probably through snowballs If not batteries and Santa Claus from the lower level of the link I think Palantir up to 140 percent for 2024 can another breakout year because the most dojo unit part of government officially Well, we're can and globally these guys. They're all part of the same circle They understand that procurement process. They will win a lot of business in 2025 Palantir Yes Next up we played a fun game at common lorries place on the university We had to draw another person our dinner table and then people had to guess who it was I'm easy to draw but I was not alone in my hairline I was alone though when it came to the bubble out of my mouth that said yes Bye bye bye and video the stock was up 170 one percent last year and also by the way had a very strong close today at 4.3 percent Of course for decent chunk of the year there was a lot of worry About a late product and a fraction's client based on wants to design its own chips because some videos cost too much Even as the return investments really larger believe me if I thought anyone could touch in videos products and platforms I'd be happy to say sell and book the game But I can't justify that because this company's pureless Probably the biggest thing working against this doctor's book the determine way trades Give me abused clumps if you're making 12 climbs for any other company I'd say abandon the stock but in videos products are too good to indispensable and it's CO runs harder than anyone else I've ever met I expect a great space from gents and wanted to see yes next Monday But please read my CNBC investing club bulletin today about my latest move on the stock Finally there's axon the body cam and taser company that owns the software's a service model for the local criminal justice system I wish I had specifics about which jurisdictions are taking their package But the growth continues to be shockingly strong both here and now overseas Maybe there aren't enough analogs, but I always feel like axon doesn't get the attention it deserves from the analyst I'd like to since it was taser And I like it even more even as the stocks up was up 130% last year needs a split to keep rolling them Hey, that's a real good collection of winners. I really like those stocks The next 100 losers though They weren't so horrible as the declines would make you think But they got clobber because they were emblematic of golden calves worship for long time before being filled is not so special after all Kind of like the false idol Edward G. Robinson worship and Kramer fave tank amendments if you don't know Robinson my colleague David favor does a great invitation Let's start with something critical intel and its financial situation intel is a national treasure people It can't be allowed to fail to dire possibility. I don't think so it's balance sheet is a mess It's product line isn't good enough. I don't know if you can deliver on many of his promises of the government sure Nice guy emesionic former CEO pack gelsiger is gone But so what intel needs a plan in 30 days or the stock will keep coming down even after last year's staggering 60% to close Amazing Intel is too big to be brought to indebted to be finesse It's a week-low situation the risk is existential second mongo db down 43% is the excess of enterprise software Or still one more company that helps you develop applications data modeling blah blah blah blah blah blah blah 2024 was the year we turned on enterprise software Some because there are too many companies doing the same thing So if you have one bit of slowness you regard as a dead man walking Mongo db is a pretty good company, but it's 72 times learning still thank you. It was a big today Hope spring's eternal Third biogeans been running on fumes while works on its Alzheimer's drug But the fumes basically a very good MS drug in a crowd of fields aren't enough not with the unmet projections for its Alzheimer's formulation or competition come from Eli Lloyd hence the stocks 41% decline Biogeans travel to close to some for too long it feels real burned out here fourth for years dexcom Just be a steady uh steady climb for the show This stock's been hurt and I think a lot of this because of Abbott's blood sugar modern device may be better even as dexcom's device Is twice as expensive of the course of a year not necessarily better but more cost effective Then by the way, it's one big reason why we don't add it for the travel trust That stocks very cheap giving out great the company is dexcom in the most recent quarter Well, let's just say it gave you an in-line forecast and a disappointing just 2% decline Oh at the client in us sales the numbers from the second half twenty twenty four shock people The Dexcom doesn't miss and the explanation some sort of sales were you or just didn't cut it So the stock finished the year down 37% I am still mystified by what happened here Finally, there's microchip if you want to exhibit a about why the fed needs to keep cutting interest rates It's microchip this semi-darker company has the misfortune to make chips for the auto industry Meaning a lot of terrible first half without some help from the fed Hey memo to all the auto seem to be in real trouble. You're afraid. Don't come down stay away from that group obvious advances into clients all the way So what I mean bottom line? Let's hope twenty twenty five is just a straightforward and Palantir hits another home run. I strategically pick when reserve drives up micro strategy Invited delivers under snitchy hips axon keeps winning jurisdictions, but app loving get some long awaited app Hayden Because I can't bring myself to roof for that last one may have money is back after the break Coming up Kramer is diving into the best and worst stocks of 2024 in the s and p 500 next Weekdays at 5 a.m. Be first on world markets first to the global business conversation Get a jump on the investing day every day with Frank Holland success starts early world wide exchange 5 a.m. Eastern CNBC The biggest winners of the nasda obviously sheer but the winners and losers in the espifah are they're harder to predict especially if you exclude Palantir in video and axon as they also made the cut in the nasda 100 the rest of them were far from obvious and they had astonishing Staying part so let's get Palantir and start with the second best performer, which is Vistra up 258 percent Vistra is the largest competitive generator of electric in the country and the second largest nuclear play Thanks to an acquisition very smart acquisition made less march We have a shortage of clean power in America and we need more of it to support the big data center build out Let me say from the outset that I'm starting to think this move is getting to be absurd Vistra's like a stock creative for a moment the visible way to play data center expansion I come back and say Vistra at a stop and ganger constellation energy are utilities with no real building to scale at the level that the stocks would indicate Although constellation got to a big contractor from the feds that could help them add more nukes if all goes well I say don't be too greedy with Vistra please because the war will disappear once people realize that it doesn't have the ability to grow fast enough to back up the smooth It can go higher, but it is starting to give me a nose bleed Number four simply astounding. It's United Airlines for the first time my life I've seen the trade more of an investment and that's what United did the stocks up 135 percent rally and cleared about well once the airline started removing capacity You know, I didn't cut back three percent of its promise mid-year capacity. I couldn't believe it Of course, that can't explain the whole run problem with bowing the production there kept some airlines Being they were kept passing constraints. They couldn't get the place and it Plus the long-on-money short-on-time thesis the burst on the scene post-COVID never really quit Oh, and get this United still sells for less than eight times this year's earnings it can actually power higher might be a good buy I would wait for five gate percent pullback You notice the chart looks like it's kind of rolling over because we scooted three of the top five as we covered them in the NAS That can house this let me give you three more from the S. A. B. Number six Texas specific land cover Corp now this is a strange out of this in series of tracks from a bankrupt barrel that's in the top vast quantities of oil and gas the premium basement We covered and I'm proud to say we really kind of nailed this but stock keep going higher The stock finished up 111 percent, but at one point it was much much higher I think the oil trade will be hurt by excess drilling something it will always seems to happen when we get a fossil fuel friendly president Now there are better stocks. I like co-carp for the chapel trust me as it is both natural gas and oil better better I think it's breaking out here number seven was generally obvious and true NASDAQs I thought about broad calm symbol AVG up 1008 percent We know we had CEO hot-tannel on the show when we were San Francisco not that long though And he laid out a vision where it's company would be making a killing from the data center It's very rare that you have a totally bank book that come on your show telling you exactly what will happen And then that executive delivers one hundred percent He's greeted with disbelief a giant upside surprise and a gigantic move higher He said it all plus I think broad comes in ending one of this turn Not too late to get on board this one. We have a nice slug for the chapel trust And by the way, I talk about it all the time in our 1020 cmbc investing club morning meeting Finally, there's target resources of 105 percent now Here's a natural gas pipeline company Maybe the key to keeping the premium grow because there's too much gas in the permit that needs to be taken away Can't be flared Targa has both the pipes and the ability to fractionate natural gas liquids while it's not a liquefied natural gas company It was believed to be a big loser when president Biden announced that pause in energy construction here go That pause is over and it that well, I think it'll be lifted immediately And that will lift target even more. By the way, I think that shinier energy was the better one to buy But I think Targa has the builder rebuild its one slash dividend And that's a good reason to stay long to stock targets for me. How about the smb's biggest losers? Wow They are powerful powerfully bad Starting with wall green stands 64 percent Here's the company needs a fire of buyers maybe some for the front of the store Desmond by amazon some for the back which could be used as a dispensary for all sorts of drugs See you Tim Wentworth. He's real good. He's closing money losing stores offering free one hour delivery Has a series of incredible bargains on the homepage check it out But the balance is just not so hot and to truly turn around Well, wall green's needs other pharmacies to go under So it can raise prices either that or it needs to break up different parts of the enterprise and sell them off down here Though I would not bet we against Wentworth You can't it the stock is too low Second modejourner with a stock down 58 percent remains a casualty of the post-COVID hangover One of the last of the zoom video and docu-sign have taken off the numbers. You're staggering staggeringly bad The market capitalization 2021 got as high as $195 billion dollars now at a 16 billion A house of pain. It's the client and revenues from 19.3 billion in 2022 to an expected 3.3 billion last last year is Popping and nauseating and we keep waiting for the promised personal vaccines I like CEO Stefan Bensell nice man But I'm sad to say that the stock would roar if the see if you were to step down as manager Even if he definitely needs to stay on to help back until the vaccines great guy But shareholders deserve better performance. There is sell in EC So federal reserve stock means a company that makes plastics one that got his clock clean down 55 percent revenues flattened profits fell Typical of all the material stocks that fall though this one like so many other industrials needed China to recover and it didn't It also needs aggressive rate cuts Until we get both. Please don't bet on this one bounce back We own several stocks and child will trust that need China to come back and all I can say is I hate those stocks Selsa well at least until they annualized to crummy Chinese numbers and then they'll probably bounce back Fourth is estate order lost 49 percent last year because it went all in China And so every part of its business pretty much full apart even as management kept promising otherwise Yep louder over promised and under delivered and the CN as that real day new mold feeling as it was also viscerid By competition from ELF beauty or elf of course management would never admit this It would never admit that it's partial way ever price compared to elves much cheaper But only slightly inferior merchandise. They would say it's radically inferior My wife couldn't tell the truth is I've never put them in front of she didn't know I mean like I've posted a story already Now we got get by this one for the child will trust leaving the CEO we were wrong. We we were cut the Arab Father's end face which is a solar equipment company is misfortune of making some of its equipment in China Given the trunk wine over solar after good vice president Harris We can expect a much higher tariffs are looming on Chinese goods I think it's amazing that end face was only down 48 percent for the year But hey, there's always 20 25 we have some possible winners among the ones that I mentioned including united airlines and broke on But for the most part the potentially big winners the SB 500 are the same as the winners we just covered the NASDAQ Palantir and video and axon the losers here's the bottom line We need to see the big plan for the Walgreens a change to top the Moderna China return to industrial growth for cell and ease a change In management and return to growth for China in China for a stay order as well as more real listening pricing and I don't even know what to do for an face sadly I don't think they know what to do either How about Robert and Texas please Robert Hi, I value your opinion and I held Apple for so long and it split so many times and Now it's like Over 30 percent of my portfolio and I feel like I should diversify you have to do much It doesn't matter you know look discipline Trump's conviction. So you will sell some Apple tomorrow I cannot have you have 30 percent Apple even though it is one of my favorite stocks That does not make sense to me. Please please please take some off the table It's good to Jonathan my homestead Pennsylvania where I was just last week Jonathan Happy blue-yay year Jim oh totally where's your accent you sound like me? Yeah, I'm Fox County right right now. Oh, yeah, it's horrible. It wasn't a great It was wonderful. Yeah, thank you Hope you had some nice time and family and friends here. I sure did thank you good for you Jim I haven't thanked you and your staff for quite a while for all the hard work you do and how much you help all of us You have made a big deal on that. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. You're welcome. Thank you for all the folks there Jim I'm looking at a little bit of a defensive play Okay, just want to even think this stocks expensive the peat and you see the little high to me on cold gate Well, I was listening. I watched Frank Holland show every morning he had a guest this morning to talk possibly about cold gate I was listening. I felt quite compelled. I said, you know what that stock has come down from 100 note nine to 90 I think you should put some one. I want to thank you for those kind words and yes, I do love bucks County I always like who up among government county. I always wanted to fear if I could ever move up in life I do it and I finally got there but it took me an awful long time Anyway, in 2024 there's a lot of overlap in the winners peen the nest that 100 yesterday As we head into this year we'll have to watch and see if the potential winners will what do they have what it takes to keep winning Much more may have money and including my look at some high-eaters It could be prime players to watch in the New York plus I'm revealing two themes that I think could drive the 2025 action on Wall Street and telling you what stocks could benefit from these trends and by of course All right, of course, about fire tonight's edition of the 2025 lightning round so stable Kramer As we kick off the new year feels like we're headed into a period full of uncertainty a few months ago We thought the federal reserve would be blessing us with a series of barely aggressive rate cuts But inflation fused to be tame and now the fizz a lot less dovish the bomb markets been moving in the wrong way since September We already had a huge Trump rally in the way into the election But we don't really know what the second Trump administration will prioritize in terms of economic policy If it's tax cuts and deregulation market will lap it up if it's tariffs will let's know the story So what works in ties of uncertainty? Well, I'll tell you what works dividend stocks These are the oldest sources of safety and it look and it doesn't hurt that they high Eaters have fallen out of favor as bond yields of sort making dividends stocks less attractive In compares if you think there's a ceiling on bond yields though Then this could be a great time to buy some high eaters when you look at every member of the SB 500 get this 128 of them pay dividends that yield three percent or more 32 you more than 4.5 percent while we were out for the holidays We embraced our time off by pouring through those 32 stocks it came up with five high eaters. It should work in 2025 First up real-time income. That's a real estate investment trust They've been on the show primarily focused on retail properties with some growth opportunities in the data centers and gaming markets Real-time really income that symbol letter O has the second highest yield among the real estate investment trust The SB 500 it's 60 percent and it's the only one that pays them monthly dividend Which is fantastic comes very handy plus the company regularly raises its payout. They raised it five times last year Now real estate income is down 19 percent from the slatted tober highs here I think that's mainly because the bond market's gotten more competitive Although Wall Street's also feeling more skittish towards some of their biggest tenants like the dollar stores Love people think Walmart's a viscerating those pharmacy chains. Well, that's Amazon right however when sweet Roy came on the show in November he explained that his companies managed to grow earnings fast in the market during periods of both high interest rates and low ones is very convincing plus even though some tenants are struggling Put it out that the copy hasn't seen any major leads from the issues and even if they do they've got so many Perspective tenants that it really wouldn't matter. I say take the six percent payout from real-time income and wait for the market to work through its Concerns about the stock Next here's an interesting one I know you ps has been a serial under performer for a couple of years now and by any fair comparison FedEx is the better operator But if you're looking for income FedEx has only a two percent yield You know you ps currently yields to worth a five percent Now back on October you ps port is surprisingly strong court and now that it's gotten past tough comparisons from generous Third quarter 2020 to be contract with the temperatures union Well, you know what the companies begin to get its cost under control though that team shares contract was really bad for them I thought so but after popping with them 5 percent response that quarter The stocks are nothing but tumble right back down again look at that as I explained not too long ago You know the parcel's primary issue right now is trust Earlier last year the company put forward some three year financial targets that Wall Street simply does not believe But if management can deliver a couple more quarters like the last one The trust could be restored and the stock could have a nice run now If match me can't do it then the board could change management and the stock will go higher too And the meantime they're paying it away with that juicy dividend I like the brisk reward there what else a number of utilities made the high yield or slits that's well about dominion energy that quote man This company that has regulated gas and electric utility businesses of Virginia and the Catalanis large clean power generation business Quitting nuclear power plant every dominion became to unwieldy with ambitious but distracting clean energy projects The company is now the invested some big assets has become much more focused operator And I like what it's focused on see dominion service area includes northern Virginia Which has one of the highest concentrations of data centers on the planet We know data centers have this sensational demand for electricity plus to manage nearly 5% dividend. You'll still don't hurt Couple regional banks made the short list of high-yielders and SB 500 I feel particularly comfortable with key court. That's that Cleveland based A parent of key bank. I don't know if you remember we had CEO Chris Gorman on just a few weeks ago I liked it. I by the way, I like many mutual banks and I've got to take key is from languishing for the better part of two years If that many banking crisis is bringing a twenty twenty three because the company didn't make some missteps with its bomb portfolio But lately a summer key corpse sold a big chunk of itself to bank of Nova Scotia Which gave them a capital reposition their bomb portfolio taking a loss in the process but putting the problem to bed Know what I think the inclusion confusion could allow key to make some acquisitions remember the FTC now more favorably in client lately a stocks portfolio again as long-term interest rates of risen causing investors to sell the regional banks in Discriminately. I think you should use that market-wide fear to buy some key court as it's already dealt with this bomb portfolio While you wait for the market for you out this stocks being unfairly punished for the legacy issue you can collect 4.8% you Finally, let's throw in a solid energy name. I'm talking about Chevron Which barely snuck one to our list of finalists with the 4.5% yield as of the end of last year This stocks basically been fly for 200 years now More or less in the since inflation peak to mid 2022 That's happened amid declining or stagnant energy prices and some companies specific issues like a major deal to acquire Which is languished for a few reasons including a dispute with exon over certain international projects But I think it's going to be hard to keep Chevron stock down from much longer at the end of the day I'm less sanguine than most about the oil industry under Trump because a drill baby drill policy That means more supply and more supply translates of course to lower prices However, there will obviously be some benefits for the integrated oils from the new regime in Washington It's simply more fossil fuel-friendly than the alkaline Biden White House Chevron is a clone of sales for less than 13 times this year's earnings estimates offering good value in a market looks increasingly stretched in places and that nearly 4.5% yield I don't know that seals the deal for me. Here's the bottom line of reality income UPS Dominion energy K-Corp and Chevron Five dividend stocks about what I'm putting your shopping list at the outset of a new year that's filled with uncertainty If you're looking out at 2025 without a clear idea of where to put new money now Well, I got to tell you those five stocks They'd be a great starting place for your capital.

I'm calling by the Everybody said yeah of the street back in the street years. Oh, sure I'm calling about a stock everybody said it was gonna be a thousand dollar stock great numbers great products Really well-run companies as far as I can tell I Started buying it just over 900 and kept buying it and went down and down and down Really hit my portfolio last year Do I sell it? Oh, should I hang on to Eli Lilly? Okay, the problem the other is people are saying you know what after a year People are no longer taking the drugs are going off at a use percentage going off it I think that you own this thing because it's about cardiac instances. It's about high high blood pressure It's about to mention may even be about cancer not just about weight and diabetes So I think you hold on to Eli Lilly. We continue to hold it for the trust I do think there'll be good numbers, but that last quarter wasn't good I totally understand the trepidation about the stock, but I still like it. How about Nick and Florida Nick Jim big blue y'all from Florida and a happy new year to you man. Oh, thank you for seeing me And my girlfriend Diana Jim this stock is down 26% in the past six months and has been a staple in my portfolio for a few years now My question to you is buy sell or hold Pickers symbol and you eat lukewarm new core. I thought new core was bottoming It's been very very tough down this great steel maker. I really got to see what It looked the material stocks are all weaker and there's a lot of dumping of steel from China yet They all they do is hack and dump and hack and dump and they get away with it. So that's what's hurting the stock It's got to Allen and Florida. Please Allen Yeah, Jim thanks for taking my call number one. I want to go higher for correctly You interviewed the chief executive officer of laboratory corporation of America And I own a lot of that stock and it seems to me that that's taxman dead money And I wonder what your thoughts were about it now You know lab corps did have a spike over COVID and I have a spell when I interviewed the CEO I think the stock at 15 times earnings is fine, but the problem is it's healthcare and people do not like the healthcare stocks What did I say and that ladies up the conclusion of the lady The lightning round is sponsored by Charles Schwab Coming up has the optimism around the market reached a fever pitch Kramer's digging into the areas where he's seeing too much speculation next The beginning years always filled with optimism That far too often the analyst gin up a sense of doom based on rates or valuations or whatever seems to be the dark flavor of the day But sometimes I gotta tell you there's too much optimism in certain sectors We've seen this movie before faster battery chargers didn't pan out new electric vehicles the failure of failure even vaccines for cancer They've never materialized This should I see two themes that I want to caution people about nuclear power and quantum computing both the promise someday But that day is not just not near enough to justify the current valuations for the stocks Right now there are two utilities that generate a lot of nuclear power Vistra in constellation energy the latter which just got a big contract with the feds one billion dollars To expand a nuclear site the big utilities are critically trying to meet power to manage and read by the data set of revolution I think these two stocks are now way ahead of themselves They trade like they'll be able to build many nuclear reactors next to the currently approved ones because citing won't be difficult Oh, that's true, but building them will be it takes ages to construct one of these things big overruns Constellations reopening a decommission through mile on plant with Microsoft signing a contractor 20 years worth of power That does sound great, but I think the process of restarting a dead nuclear power plant won't be easy But hey at least constellation invests for real even if their stocks have gotten over extended when it comes to nuclear power over enthusiasm We've seen more some of these smaller copies of the wealthful terms of the current plants they worry me companies like aqua with nuclear Fission capabilities new scale power with small form factor technology. They're exciting But they're also years from developing anything meaningful or is my friend Michael Sembliss chair of the market and investment strategy group and JP Morgan wrote And it's unbelievably pressing 20 25 outlook what nuclear redness odds wake me when we get there I don't want to go into this because there's so many of these companies that are devoid of any revenue I will say that the most important builder of nuclear plants in this country G for Nova is about as bearer says the promoter's unbush I tried to code CEO Scott Strazy to be more positive on the prospects But he won't after all the engineering hurdles cost over runs and balance sheet damage associated with his plants He doesn't expect anything commercially viable for about a decade So I don't think you want to be in any of these nuclear stocks for too long How about quantum computing look quantum computing is not a host No, it's kind of a low bar output as a facility dedicated to quantum computing This is super fast computing using superconductors that require a specialized computer environment based in part on cryogenic technology sounds promising The others burn too hot right the regular data centers, but it's not a reason to buy out but because it's nothing It's ready at scale. I like outfit on a for the travel trust But that's because we like their dominance in search progress in YouTube and credible strength of Google cloud services Well, I had a word people think quantum computing is just a long term project But then for example when I look at regetti computing and it's a 5.6 billion dollar company Professors be a leader in quantum computers and superconductor equipment. I grow concerned regetti is a multiple year money loser With just 11.9 million revenues in the last 12 months this stock was a 66 cents for months ago now It's a 20 bucks up over 30% just today It's big break occurred at the end of November when it sold 50 million shares at two bucks This stock was off the races ever ever since that hey, it's a quantum game stop Okay, I am wary of dewey of quantum a 2.2 billion dollar company with 9 million of revenues over the last 12 months and very big losses I'm also concerned about a company called quantum computing 2.4 billion dollars with 400,000 new revenues in the last 12 months and again very big losses look I believe nuclear power but when G even over the company has arguably has the most the game from it says Disgurging things about it uptick and commercial nuclear power coming anytime soon when quantum computing seems very much into infancy Well, I fear people get hurt speculating on even the biggest companies better one the smaller ones You can speculate of course, but please understand that Like at all new years the animal spirits are in play for a few stocks And I don't want you to be trampled by wayward bulls with visions of riches in front of their greedy eyes You know and we're getting you just one take some gains and then go out and fireself a nice cashmere sweater I like to say there's always one market summer promised to find it just for you right here.
