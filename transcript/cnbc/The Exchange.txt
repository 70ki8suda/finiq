Check out the MX Golf Tournament from California, inauguration day, and the meeting of world leaders in Davos Plus the first Fed decision of the year. The investing edge you need to start the year ahead of the game. CNBC You're listening to the exchange. Here's today's show. Welcome to the exchange. I am Frank Holland and for Kelly Evans. Happy holidays and here's what's ahead. The bull market is in tech, but there is one thing our market guest says could derail it next year. She joins us with what it is and what she's buying with that in mind. Plus the read on retail are analysts is seeing some clear trends emerging for the new year and she brings the stocks that stand to benefit this. Take a look. This is one of the gains, one of the names with gains in sight. That's kind of a holiday hint. It's up 78% this year. At me if you think you know what it is. I'm on Twitter, I'm on Instagram, even on TikTok. And the stakes are high for Netflix to get it right from the technical to the bottom line. We look at why tomorrow's NFL games are critical for the streamer, but we begin with today's markets and a gentleman that knows all about sweater weather. John, shoot the numbers. It's the holiday sweater season right now, right? Sweater is better than suits during this time of year, at least for me. Anyway, as we talk about the move in the markets right now, we're starting to see a little bit of a bounce. We're going to try to close out this holiday short and training day on a high note. For that matter right now, we are right near session highs for the three major indices. The Dow industrials at 43,001,08, it's up roughly 200 points or about a half of 1% gain. Even bigger percentage gain, three quarters of 1% for the larger S&P 500. Currently at 6,017, it's up about 43 points. At the highs of the session, we were up 45. So again, right near those session highs, up seven points at the lows. That is your intraday training range so far. Remember, 6,099 is the recurrent record high level. The NASDAQ composite really leading the advance here, that tech heavier trade up 1,4%, 197 points for the NASDAQ composite to 19,962. From a macro perspective, turning now towards the cryptocurrency side of things, we're seeing at least a little bit of a move within a broader training range over the course of the last month and a half or so. Bitcoin price is currently at 98,200. That's up about 5.5% so a strong move higher. Now this is the range that we're dealing with. Remember on the high end, since about November 11th, we're talking about 108,000 thereabouts per Bitcoin and about 88,000 on the lows since again, the middle of November. So that is your kind of range so far, a $20,000 range, at least medium term. Keep an eye on that. And then from a rate standpoint, it's hard to believe, but we're right now near session highs for the 10-year note yield. So again, bonds for the US government selling off in value. The yields rising to 4.62% over the course of this kind of year-to-date period. The lows that we saw earlier this fall, currently around 3.62, and then 4.62 at the high. So a full percentage point in terms of yield difference between the lows of the year and the highs of the year, we'll see if that becomes a theme going into 2025, Frank, for those yields. I'll send things back over to you guys. All right, Dom, thank you very much. Well, as yields rise, probabilities for rate cuts next year, they continue to decline. The CNBC Senior Economics Reporter, Steve Leesman has more. Steve, happy holidays. Good to see you. Hey, Frank, yeah, happy holidays to you. Well, optimism and uncertainty looked to be the two main. And I'd say conflicting things for 2025. Consider some of the data we got just this morning. The outlook in the Philly Feds non-manufacturing index shows the optimism that we've seen in business survey after business survey. The outlook had a new three-year high, eclipsing last month's three-year high. Expectations in the rich defense manufacturing outlook. Also this morning showed several components reaching new, multi-year highs and much of that optimism has got to be linked to high hope from policies from the incoming administration. But an offset to all that optimism comes from the outlook for fed rate cuts. Future markets have vowed in one rate cut next year, but they are decidedly unsure about a second. That trade was just a 40% probability in December. That's the bar on the right of your screen, the probability for a second cut. The 10 year, it's gone the other way while the fed has cut rates while the 10 year yield, it did decline. You can see there in anticipation of those cuts, 100 basis points of cuts actually delivered from the fed offset by 100 basis points of games in the 10 year yield. So those are the themes so far, optimism versus uncertainty. You have deficit hogs out there in the GOP versus the president elect wanting to cut taxes. And all the promises he's made there, you have fed rate cuts versus still sticky inflation and potentially expansionary fiscal policy. So a surge in the economy in 2025 fueled by tax cuts deregulation, but offset by tariffs and still high and maybe growing deficits, that's going to be seen as increasing the inflation risk by the Fed. They've already up there inflation risk outlook. That's going to mean a more cautious Fed, more cautious to cut in 2025 until Frank, the Yavok becomes less uncertain. All right, so Steve, really interesting data there. You know Steve, by the way, you know I like to think of myself as the junior economics reporter. So I have a question for you. Aren't we really just one jobs report, one inflation report away from all this changing again? I mean, the dual main data is the key. J. Powell stressed the importance of the jobs market several times, and then he's even referenced inflation this time. If we see a meaningful change, doesn't that just change the outlook altogether? I think it could. And I think what's smart about your question is we're coming out of a period of a lot of distortion in the jobs market, the jobs reports we've had. You had those hurricanes and the strikes, then you had the bounce back from them. So the December report, even though there's going to be a lot of holiday, hiring and firing and all that stuff, season and stuff, it'll at least be beyond those restrictions, Frank. So if we do get a week report, I do think it will increase the odds of that second rate cut being in there, but that's not going to undo the uncertainty that's out there. More broadly though, your question is, if there is broad economic weakness, then I think what you're going to do is you're going to have the market not be concerned so much with the outlook for deficits and expect more fiscal spending and probably more rate cuts. So you're right. A broader weakness that would probably change things around. All right. Next job report coming up in that first week of January, we'll have to wait and see. Steve Leesman, great to see you. Enjoy the holiday. It's a second week, I think, Frank. I think it's think it's January 10th. Just more so. It's a weird one. Well, I'm counting it the first one. It's a weird one. It's a weird one. Within the first couple of days, but you know, generally it's in that first week. Well, if you take off the first week, then it is the first week. Yeah. Steve, I hope you're not taking off. I'm hoping to see you, but as you mentioned, it is January 10th. Steve Leesman, great to see you. Okay. Good. All right. My next guest says the biggest risk in 2025 is policy error, including a possible mistake by the Fed, which is a sure way to kill off a bull market in her opinion. Joining me now is Victoria Green, Chief Investment Officer at G-Squared Private Wealth. Vicki, happy holidays. Good to see you. Good to see you, Frank. Many Christmas. Merry Christmas to you as well. All right. So you're worried about some type of policy error. What are we talking about? Are we talking about possible tariffs? Are we talking about the Fed cutting its outlook from four to two cuts? What is it that you're so concerned about? It's the concern. The Fed is too early to late, too slow to pass. They have a very thankless job. You know, if they get it wrong, like, transitorian inflation, then it could certainly derail the bull market. We're calling our outlet for 2025 bullish with a bot. Because now we have so much uncertainty, like you and Steve were just talking about, we have issues with, could we see major cuts to government expenditures? Could we see major cuts to government employment? Both of those could destabilize the Fed path. Could we see the Fed be too early or too late and destabilize some of the stability we've seen in the rates market? Absolutely. So for us policy error is always the tried and true way to kill off a bull market. It doesn't die from old age, doesn't die from high PEs. Bull markets can be killed off, though, by policy error. And those stakes continue to rise next year because we have so many uncertain things that may or may not occur. So Vicki, did you think that the hawkish cut that we got on the 18th was that a policy error? And I know you're very bullish on growth and on tech. If you look at the charts ever since that cut, you see the max 700 performed in the market. You see software underperforming the market. If you look at the IGV, you see cybersecurity underperforming the market. I mean, just about everything's underperforming. So in your mind, was the hawkish cut the policy error that the market needs to worry about? I think it was. I saw no reason for another cut. And I think they did need to rip the bandaid off. I was happy to see the dot plot recalibrate it because if we're seeing strong economic growth, stability and inflation and employment, why is the Fed continuing to cut? I also talked to the 50 basis points early in the year was not needed. We weren't in some emergency situation. So for me, I feel like they've reacted a little bit too harshly. I think that's one reason we saw that huge sell off on last Wednesday. When they said, Oh, hey, maybe we've moved too fast. Now we're going to take our foot off the gas and the market again had to strongly recalibrate. So, okay, now we're expecting one, maybe two cuts next year, which is what you should have. If you have stable and growing economic policy. And if we have a GDP growth situation, if we have increased earnings, we shouldn't be cutting. We should only be cutting if inflation's going the right direction. It has been very, very sticky or if unemployment picks up, which is likely the bigger risk. I see, especially if we do see the, the doge community go into full swing here. And we start to see the, the size of the federal government possibly state and local governments shrink as they react to that. All right. So we'll get some answers on that coming up on January 10th with the jobs report. I do want to ask you about two other areas that a lot of people I'm talking to are concerned about. The rise in the dollar dollar up more than 1% since the Fed decision. Also, the rise in bond yields up more than 20 basis points since the Fed decision. Does that make it at all concerned about Q1 earnings, just some of this pressure from those two areas? Yes. The US dollar going up is a huge concern. Multinationals have a lot of more exposure to that. You look at some of the companies like Pepsi has about 50% of their earnings are coming from outside the US. So we do think there's some risk. You could see some, some US dollar drag. I think some of it's going to be explainable that it won't be quite the, the, the knee jerk reaction. If they say, Hey, we missed, but the years are currency drag and, and investors may be able to take that with those grain assault on the yields front. I think we're okay unless we hit five. If we start creeping up towards 5% on the 10 year, I get a little bit more concerned on what that does to US growth markets and longer duration equity after absolutely in this area between 4.5, 4.75. We've been here before this year. I'm not too concerned yet, but yeah, if we break out of 4.75, head to five, then I get a little bit more concerned about the yield drag absolutely. All right, by the way, we're showing your S&P 500 price target for next year, 7100. You're one of the more bullish price targets I've seen when it comes to the S&P. I want to get to some of your picks. You have a couple of them for us. Netflix, we're going to talk about that later in the show. Also energy transfer, constellation energy. I want to get to your other one Blackstone, having a very strong year, up about 30% year to date. I do want to ask the, what is it you like about this alternative player here? When I look at the valuation, it's pretty expensive at about 32 times. This is a market that seems like it's priced to perfection and now we're seeing some weakness due to these elevated valuations. Is there something in Blackstone's business in particular that you like? Because I look at some of the other names, much lower valuation when you look at an Aries or a Carlyle. Sure, I like Blackstone because of their scale and I think you're actually going to turn the corner on them. They are heavy real estate. Be reached one of the largest non-traded reach out there and we're starting to actually see realizations pick up. Barclays just sat down with their CEO and they're talking about 2025 outlook. Bonnie might get some things off the book, get things moving, get more realizations, IPOs and that will definitely help the stock. But it's not just about that. They continue to grow. They're over a trillion in assets. Their scale is massive and the next frontier continues to be retail clients and the Holy Grail, which is a risk of plans in 401k, which is a long game. But we see them pushing into that with the integral funds and I think their known scale, their sales distribution network will allow them to continue to grow their product. They were up 40 billion in new assets just last quarter and I think they're going to continue to grow and justify and their fee revenues continue to grow and justify this multiple. So yes, is it cheap? Absolutely not. But I think it's worth the premium here because of its growth outlook and its ability to push into new markets. Look at the rise of private credit. I think you're going to see as if the yields continue to come down on this front end, you're getting a lot less of money market, short-term bonds, everybody's been doing tea bill and chill. Suddenly you might get pushed out of that a little bit next year and you might be looking for alternative ways to generate more with less maybe volatility than intermediate treasuries. You could be seeing more and more flows into the private credit sector. So I'm very bullish on this stock absolutely. All right, thank you for letting you go. I do have to ask you about the financial sector. Another area that you're very bullish on, the Bank Policy Institute actually suing the Federal Reserve of the annual stress test. Your view on that, I know you're worried about policy. I mean, this is obviously the big banks pushing back on policy. Yeah, I think this was a pretty, yeah, I think every institution is going to be pushing back every industry after the Chevron decision here saying, hey, we want a lighter regulatory touch. So they did talk about the fact what they were asking for was public comment and the Fed came out saying, hey, we are going to possibly be getting public comment. So they said, hey, we want to get this lawsuit in the books. Just in case it's not the way we see the Fed going. The Fed was already moving in ways to kind of appease this group, but the Fed acknowledged, hey, after the Chevron decision regulatory agencies might have to have a lighter touch, which again makes me very bullish on financials. If we see less issues with stress tests, less issues with capital controls, less issues with, hey, your balance sheet has to be exactly this. Thanks can lend more, banks can make more money. And I think some of this was a little bit the Fed kind of front ran it a little bit, but they still wanted it in the books. Just in case it's not what they wanted to see in 2026, they've got this lawsuit ready to go. All right, Vicki Green from G Square. Great to see you, enjoy the holiday. I'm sure I'll see you soon. Thanks, Frank. All right, time out of turn to retail in the consumer. Of course, Christmas is tomorrow. Vista with new data showing holiday retail spending. It increased almost 5% year over year. That's despite a shorter shopping window between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. But the outlook from here becoming more uncertain with consumer confidence dropping and tariff cited as one of the reasons why. And that's why my next guest is watching as what she's watching as well for more of the potential impact of tariffs on retailers. And the name's best position in the new year. Let's bring in Dana Telsi, CEO and Chief Research Officer of Telsi Advisory Group Dana. Happy holidays. Good to see you. Happy holidays. Nice to see you too. All right, so Dana, answer this question from you. I've been talking a lot of people about the retail sectors. We talk about it on my show World Wide Exchange. Are tariffs just bad for retail overall or are there some companies that might actually benefit? Well, when you have companies, some of the companies make a lot of the goods here in North America, they'll benefit. You look at bathroom bodyworks where 85% of their goods are made in North America. That's an opportunity for them. You look at Berkensstock where most of their goods are made in Germany and in Portugal with the cork, that'll be fine for them. But the speed to diversify your sourcing because there is no China like China is something that all our companies are gravitating towards. And a lot of it certainly is in the athletic area where there's been more exposure. All right, so if companies are looking to diversify their supply chain, generally that increased cost. Does that mean that cost is going to be passed on in consumers? And when I look at the credit card data, record high levels of credit card debt right now, 1.16 trillion, should we be worried about higher prices in the new year? Yes, with tariffs coming and if they do come and you pay most of the retailers and brands have to pass on the price increases, that is a headwind. And that's why you're continuing to see the value retailers, whether it's the off-pricers, whether it's discounters like Walmart, continue to gain share. And you're seeing more brands even sell through these value channels. One other question I want to ask you about, this is a little bit in the weeds, but I was talking to some traders about this, about retail in particular. When it comes to tariffs right now, there's an exemption. They call it a demonimus exemption that basically leaves goods from companies like a shien, a t-moo, untarif. So if that was taken away, it would hit those fast fashion names. Are there other companies, publicly traded companies that would benefit if the cost of shien and t-moo and those other fast fashion names were just higher? When you think about fast fashion overall, take a look at the end of taxes in the H&M. H&M makes around 25% of their goods in China. The umbrella that you have with off-price, and off-price would be a beneficiary, is there always price lower than brand names. The other area that you would have is when you look at many of the specialty apparel retailers, even companies like Abercrombie and Fitch, where they've gotten their sourcing from China down to single digits. And I think it would benefit some of those retailers also. All right. One thing you're watching is supply chain. I was actually just talking to a big logistics company today just about customers pulling forward ahead of tariffs, ahead of a possible port strike. Also, Lunar New Year is a bit earlier this year, so it's like three big things coming up in January that could really jam up the supply chain. Is that almost definitely going to raise the price of a lot of these things that are getting pulled forward from when I'm hearing higher margin big ticket items? I mean, for big screen TVs or high-end retail, does that automatically push up the price? Or do you think retailers, do they absorb some of those costs? I mean, it's always a little bit of absorbing costs and it's always passing some of it on. We know from the tariffs last time retailers passed on some of the costs. What's different this time is the agility that many of the retailers have in order to diversify, in order to manage their cost structure, they're able to deal with it. But not when you, if you have China, Mexico, and Canada, there's only so much wiggle room they have of where to source merchandise, except for companies, like I mentioned, Bath & Body Works, and Berkand Stock. All right. I want to get back to our mystery chart. You said that you could see some gains in the year ahead. It's Warby Parker, by the way. What is it about this eyeglass retailer that has you so bullish about it? You know what I like about Warby Parker? You take a look at their retail stores, they're crowded. You look at the expansion that they're doing of their customer base with partnering with insurance companies, they're getting an increased customer base. You take, or not an increase, you get more customers. You take a look at what they're adding on the optometrist in their stores. And where do most people buy glasses? There's an attachment sale from where you get your eye exam, and adding contacts and progressives, and the fact that some of the new stores are operating at higher sales capacities and higher sales plans than originally expected. And don't forget that you also have their online business too. So it's growing, you have the benefit post-COVID of now people coming back, and buying glasses, and glasses aren't just for essentials, they're for fashion too. They get a little bit of both, and I think they're winning in 2025. Yeah, it's only like a very interesting business model. I don't wear glasses, I've never been one of the stores, but if you can get your eye exam there and buy your glasses there, I'd imagine that leads to a lot of sales. They're in a tellsy. Exactly. Really great to see you have a great holiday. You two happy holidays. Alright, coming up here on the exchange. Retail isn't the only group with a lot of stake this holiday. Netflix's live event coverage facing a real make or break moment that I sympathize and qualify. That was kind of a technical train wreck. Can Netflix can it handle the NFL? That's coming up next. It's CNBC's big January with CES from Las Vegas, Biotech and Farma at JPM Healthcare, the World Economic Forum in Davos, and the first fed decision of the year. Start the year ahead of the game. CNBC. And welcome back to the exchange. Tomorrow on Netflix and the NFL, they're teaming up for the very first time to stream NFL games. The streaming giant is bringing two Christmas day games to subscribers as it looks to expand its push into live programming. Ardria Borson has more on what to expect in today's tech check. Hey Frank, well, Netflix has estimated 150 million dollar deal for two NFL games. It's designed to be a win-win giving Netflix a valuable content to power its new ad business and giving the NFL massive global reach. Netflix shares are up nearly 90% in the past year in part on the potential of Netflix's ad-supported lower priced tier and sports are key way to drive real-time viewership that's essential for advertisers. Oppenheimer estimates that Netflix is generating $150 million in ad revenue between those two games tomorrow, which is the same as their licensing costs. So Oppenheimer says the games offer huge subscriber acquisition Upside. Now if tomorrow's games work both technically and by reaching a new more global audience for the NFL, it sets the stage for the NFL's continued global expansion. The NFL plans a record eight international games next year up from five this year as the NFL considers as many as 16 international games in the future. And the NFL does have the opportunity to renegotiate most of his contracts early after the 2028-2029 season and Netflix could be a natural fit as a buyer for a new package of international games. The reach is global and you'll see global franchises like Squid Games and other programming that has really worked across the planet. That is giving us the opportunity for the first time to think of one partner and think globally at the same time. As for concerns about technical glitches and last month's Mike Tyson, Jake Paul fight on on Netflix sources tells the NFL commissioner is confident in Netflix's streaming capabilities and that he is in close touch with Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandas. Thanks to our Julia Borsten for that. My next guest says while sure as a performer much better than he expected, he thinks growth is likely to slow down from here. He has a neutral rating and a $680 price target for the stock. I stumble because the stock's trading at about 930 right now. Let's bring in Bart and Crockett, senior analyst and managing director at Rosenblad Securities. Bart and Happy Holidays. Great to have you on board. Yeah, thank you. Happy Holidays to you, Frank. All right. So Bart, I just want to be clear. 680 price target. You're not even the lowest on the street, but 680 to stock trading at right around 930 right now. I don't imagine that your price target is hinging on the NFL game, but you're a little, our NFL games that you're a little bearish on the company right now. So first question for you. Do you think Netflix can pull it off? Well, I think that this is this is a really big test and look, they did really surprisingly well with the audience that they pulled in for this Tyson Paul fight over 100 million views globally. 35% share in prime time of 18 to 49, like half a Super Bowl, but twice a regular season in NFL game in this country. So the question is, can they elevate sports that they carry generally like they did with this Tyson Paul fight? So, you know, if we see explosive viewership for the NFL games tomorrow, you know, beyond what we would have seen on television, then yeah, you have to really kind of rethink the story constructively. But if not, and I think my sense right now is it's more likely in this camp, if it's a little bit below television, you know, then we're left with a story that has multiple vectors of slow down last year and explosive year in margin growth and explosive year in subscriber growth, the upcoming year likely to decelerate a bit from that. So, what I do have to ask you, didn't Netflix kind of juice it a little bit? I mean, you have Mariah Carey performing, you also have Beyonce performing. Doesn't that kind of change it from just a regular NFL game? I mean, I would imagine those two personalities alone are going to bring in a lot of viewers. So is this quite the maker break moment that a lot of us are kind of positioning it to be? Yeah, look, I mean, you're right. If those celebrities make this, you know, a different game sure, you know, and it's TBD. My sense right now is that there's a lot of people who don't even know the NFL is on Netflix on Christmas Day. And, you know, they'll have to battle through that, you know, people are used to kind of turning on television if they want to watch football. So we'll see if they're able to transition to the new distribution and the awareness, you know, but we'll find out. I mean, this is a real moment for them. You know, if they can do it, if they can, you know, shatter the viewership expectations again, you know, then it's a different mouse trap and a better mouse trap for sports. And that's a real challenge for TV and very constructive for Netflix. So Barton, walk me through your price target. Again, 680 stocks at about 930, CoCO, 10RAN, as I said, people like live events. So they're doing more live events. People don't like technical glitches. So that's obviously one issue they have to face. But in general, they're bringing more live events. They're also bringing a lot of really popular things like wrestling on board. What's going to lead this stock to basically crater it? I'm going to go from 930 to 680. Yeah, look, I mean, we're arguing that this should be a stock that trades at close to a 30 PE right now. It's trading at about a 46 PE. You know, we think that earnings per share growth is kind of normalized in the 20% range, which is supportive of a little bit of a premium, but not the kind of 2X premium that we're seeing right now. So look, part of it is that they've had a big lift and subscriber growth from the end of paid sharing that has to come to an end. And part of it is that the ad ramp will take time to accelerate sports as part of the story, but they're also competing in a market that's really pivoting from brand towards performance. They're good in brand. They're evolving, you know, basically emerging in performance. And there's some really good players out there that are better positioned than Netflix for performance like Amazon where they can connect you to the checkout cart. So, you know, I do think that we're not going to see the same growth going forward that we have seen. And I think that's an argument for the multiple to pull in. But the sports thing is a real transformative test. If they can beat my expectations again, a lot of us kind of be anchored in what they do with sports near term. I mentioned a question about the broader streaming space. I guess from my show worldwide exchange earlier today, they had an estimate. They say to watch every NFL game, it would take seven different streaming services and cost you about 1500 bucks annually. So, with that kind of cost right there, I would imagine that there might be some people deciding only one six streaming services, maybe only one five. Who benefits as we see this push for live events and sports and all these streaming services? Let's take it beyond the NFL. Who benefits as we see this fragmentation and streaming and live events? Who gets hurt? Yeah, look, I think that over time sports will migrate to the strongest business platforms. And over time, that is going to be the tech giants. So, it's going to be people like Amazon. That's going to be people like Alphabet Google. That's going to be people like Apple. Netflix, potentially in that mix, Disney, you know, potentially in that mix. But people have other businesses that they can attach sports to. And, you know, I think that the TV bundle is going to be the loser over time. I think this idea of a sports floor is going to be challenged as we see more things like FIFA World Cup, women's world club, moving to Netflix, things like the NBA, moving from Turner to Amazon. As you lose those big sports anchors, you know, the TV bundle is going to be a source of economic value for the big streamers and big tech platforms. So, I understand your sense is going to be some cord cutting. But certainly out of all these big streamers, somebody has to lose out. I mean, people, I know I'm personally, I'm not going to buy seven different services. I have the Sunday ticket. I can see the games. I can see I have Netflix. I can see those games, but I'm not buying everything. Yeah, you're not buying everything. You know, there will be, you know, a range of outcomes, people, you know, some people will subscribe to more services, perhaps than you. But clearly, scale matters. And clearly, it's very challenging for those at the low end of the scale spectrum. So, we wonder about, you know, some of the streamers attached to the big media conglomerates, you know, like a Paramount Plus and others. And, you know, and then, you know, at the other end of the spectrum, you know, people like An Amazon seem really, really well positioned, you know, with so many things that they have going on to drive value through their video platform. All right, Burton, Crocket of Rosenblatt. Your price are going on Netflix. It is 680. Stock training about 930 right now. Really appreciate your time and your insight. Have a great holiday. Thank you. Coming up here on the exchange, sending the table for 2025. It was kind of a mixed bag for restaurant stocks this year.

Now let's get it get to our SEMA Modi, for a CNBC news update. Happy holiday, SEMA. Good to see you. Hello, Frank. Here's a news update at this hour. President, a like Donald Trump said today he will direct his justice department to vigorously pursue the death penalty when he assumes office on January 20th. The statement comes just one day after President Biden commuted the sentences of 37 out of the 30 federal inmates on death row. Pre-construction work to design a new Francis Scott Key bridge in Baltimore will reportedly begin early in the new year. Contractors will conduct topographic and underwater surveys as well as soil sampling as early as January 7th. That's according to the Baltimore Sun. The first steps in rebuilding the bridge comes about 10 months after a container ship lost power and crashed into one of its supporting columns causing it to collapse. And hundreds of visitors to the Eiffel Tower were evacuated today after a fire alarm malfunction on the elevator at the tourist attraction. The iconic landmark will progressively open later today but with limited access to the top floors, officials say visitors were never in danger despite initial fears of a fire at the monument. Frank, I'll send you back to you. All right, Sima. Thank you very much. Coming up here on the exchange, transports having a rough end to the year, down around 10 percent in a month and nearly flat year to date. But our next guest says the economic backdrop, it looks good. So we'll transports hit the ground running in 2025. We will discuss that much more when the exchange returns. Zadal transports down nearly 9 percent over the past month and there are several events that could put pressure on this broader group from here. There are potential strikes, tariffs and the lunar new year all on deck coming up next month. But our next guest bullish on the sector and see several catalysts from here for more on the catalyst and the concerns for transports in 2025. Joining me is Don Brotton, managing partner at Brotton Capital. Don, good to see you. Don, I know you keep your ear to the streets at all time. I was just talking to a big logistics and supply chain company. They said they're seeing a pull forward of freight, especially on the west coast where imports for containers were up 19 percent year over year in November. A lot of that's due to a potential strike and also tariffs, containers generally consumer goods, sneakers, laptops, etc. Is that all a pull forward of tariffs or do you think something else might be behind that surge? Again, 19 percent of the west coast ports in November. Well, that certainly makes a nice narrative. The truth of the matter is, we saw this pull forward starting this pull forward starting back in June and July when it was uncertain as to whether or not who was actually going to be the Republican and Democratic candidates, quite frankly, as much as who is going to be the winner. And so I don't think it's that much as we'd like to make it. Far too often the truth is not as linear as our human brains would like it to be. We've seen this surge. In fact, if you look at the third quarter volumes we saw in coming in. So, August September, October, volume as we saw coming into the ports. We saw as much as we saw as a previous peak back in 2022 or within 50,000 containers up. So, I think that's more us looking for an answer where it doesn't exist. All right, fair enough. You know one way you look for answers when it comes to transports. The Dow transports theory that you can read the moves and the Dow transports to give you a read on the economy. Is that the case right now? We just mentioned transports almost flat year-to-date. Well, you know, it's because the transports themselves are somewhat confused. You got to break the transports in order to get the real predictive value. You got to break the transports into people who move transports that move goods and transports that move people. Paying transports that move people don't predict anything. And it's really not the transports companies themselves that are somehow omniscient or pre-efficient. What really tells the future is the goods they're moving. And so those, if you move more goods, these are assets and intensive companies. You see higher asset utilization. And so you see higher margin, which gets your higher earnings, which gets your higher stock price. So it's the goods. It's the underlying goods flow that predicts what's going on in the economy, not the stocks that are somehow omniscient or pre-efficient. So then now read these tea leaves for me. I'm looking at the chart of FedEx. Last week that they spent off of their free business and LTL trucking business, stock popped big. Then the next day, I believe it actually closed lower. I'm looking since that announcement, down one and a half percent. Also, the rest of the companies in that LTL sector, names like an XBO and old Dominion, Asaya, all of them are trading lower. They move goods. The freight spin-off is supposed to be good for the overall industry. What's going on? No, first of all, they think this freight spin-off is a good idea, but then they also then announced it's going to take them 18 months to spin it off. So then everybody's excitement got a group call because nobody on Wall Street likes to wait 18 months for anything, first of all. Second of all, if you're going to spout off with the price of XBO is going to be or old Dominion or any of this, tell me what two of those stocks were a year ago, two years ago. I mean, two years ago, XBO was a $45 stock and now it's $155 stock. So we've come a long way. If you look at the volumes of inbound containers, if you look at the volumes of Asia Pacific in particular, air freight, which tells us that the tech boom isn't teed intact, then you get much more bullish about the overall economy. All right. I know you're bullish about the overall economy. You're bullish about transports, but coming up in January, we have a couple of events that have the potential to create one of the biggest supply chain crises that we've seen since the pandemic. We got to keep it in perspective. I don't think there'll be anything like the pandemic ever again, but we'll start. Seriously, let's hope not. Potential strike at the east in the Gulf ports. We have possibly tariffs starting on an auguration day. And then we have Lunar New Year much earlier than normal. It starts on January the 29th. Normally, there's a pull-forward of freight, as we mentioned earlier, about two weeks ahead of time. If you just do the math here, this could create a big log jam, especially at those West Coast ports. For investors, how should they view the possibility of all this happening? Well, let's walk through those one at a time. First of all, tariffs are terrible taxes. And I think Trump understands that. But what I think he also understands is that there's some a lot of progress that could be made in trade agreements through bravado and posturing. I mean, let's face it, if you go back to us, I'm different with all those who say, we don't know what we're going to get this time. You just don't know what he's going to do. Well, yeah, actually, we do know what he's going to do. We've seen four years of this before. And people say, oh, there's going to be these horrible 50%. 80% tariffs. It's like, well, no, I believe that we're going to get those kinds of trade-stopping tariffs when the Mexicans finish building the wall they're going to pay for. He makes these threats, but they're negotiations. They may sound like ultimatums, but they're just simply negotiations. So before we say that that's going to be the tariff we have to deal with. Let's just see what actually happens. One, two, we have the timing of the Chinese New Year fluctuates back and forth every year. And you know, what it ends up normally being, in this case, a very early one means we have more heavily weighted February is really what it might normally ends up being. And the strikes, well, we've already seen a shift back towards West Coast ports as a result of the threat just in the last few months. I think that shift continues until the East Coast labor is subtle. It's just, it's like many things this too will pass, but the overall volumes are up. All right, Don Bruton. Straightening people out right now, let us start, has them about the wall and an optimistic outlook of trifecta. Don, great to see you. Have a good holiday. Always a pleasure. Hey. All right, coming up here on the exchange investors will be carefully watching this week. The CFA Snellan-Clos rally comes to Wall Street. Right now stocks are heading higher with the Nasdaq once again leading the way coming up. We'll look at some of the individual names that are on the move. Stay with us. Welcome back to the exchange. Take a look at the markets right now. We are at Session Hives right now. You can see the Dow up over 250 points. The S&P also up over three quarters and one percent. The Nasdaq, the best performer, one a percentage basis up over one percent. The Russell also up about a half a percent. Back to the S&P reclaiming that 6,000 level. The Nasdaq just shy of 20k. Here are some movers this hour. We're going to start with Apple. The stock continuing its steady climb hitting a new all-time high. Yes, today up 11 percent over the past month and that market cap is getting closer and closer to $4 trillion in number to watch there. $264.62. Palantir, another stock continuing a strong recent run. It's up nearly 400 percent this year. Look at that chart up over 1.5 percent today. But, and it's a big but only three of the 20 analysts covering the stock. Give it a buy or a strong buy rating. The average price target of Palantir also just about half of where the stock is right now. We're also looking at Bitcoin rising today, bringing back the minors and other Bitcoin-related names, micro strategy of course, but also had eight marathon and riot. All of them gaining. You see marathon up just about 4.5 percent. You see riots up over 6 percent. And if Bitcoin is just isn't volatile enough for you to check out quantum computing stocks. Today, we're getting computing one of the most actively traded names. You see that stocks up over 6.5 percent. The stock actually bouncing back big time after its post-fed drop last week. It's up more than 50 percent in the last three sessions and up over. This is correct. 600 percent over the last month. Also one of the top holdings in the QTUM quantum computing ETF. You're looking for a broader way to play it. All right, coming up. Some food for thought. In a banner year for the markets dominated by tech stocks, McDonald's and Starbucks. They're both lower for 2024. Should you better want to turn around those names next year. We're going to talk about it. The exchange coming up right after this break. Welcome back to the exchange. Shares of McDonald's are up nearly 12 percent over the past six months. And my next guest thinks the biggest they may get even bigger in 2025 with the launch of the company's new value menu coming in January. Do you want to be now to discuss why he named McDonald's a top pick? And look at the rest of his restaurants, stocks that he covers, Andy Barish, managing director of equity research at Jeffries, Andy. Great to have you here. Hi, Frank. Thanks for having me. All right, while we start with it, McDonald's, why is this value menu so important for McDonald's? We keep talking about the strong consumer, the strong economy. Why are cheaper menu items so important for this name? Yeah, it really goes back to the lower end consumer, you know, kind of that under $50,000 a year household that does continue to struggle. And McDonald's probably along with a lot of the other quick service restaurant brands over indexes to that lower end consumer. So giving that consumer reasons to come back, driving frequency is a paramount importance in terms of regaining share and moving with some momentum into 2025. All right, by the way, your price target for McDonald's is 345. You also have it at a buy right now. What about the rest of the restaurant space? What are you expecting when it comes to same store sales, a key metric when it comes to the broader restaurant space? And we said, you think the bigger going to get bigger? Does that mean these big chain restaurants, whether it's quick service or fast casual, those are going to be the beneficiaries? It seems that way. That's the way 24 was. We think 25 will kind of be a normal year. You're right. This is probably the first year in a couple where we're not debating about recession or not. The consumer overall does appear to be healthy. The holidays are rolling along very nicely. And we think it's going to be a year where same store sales are up probably 2, 3% traffic in the industry is kind of flat to slightly negative, which is not that different than what we saw in the decade leading up to COVID. And the promotional environmental continue to be fairly sharp, which tends to bode well for those that are everyday value leaders and can offer a great value, whether that's price, whether that's experience or a combination of a number of factors. Obviously, we mentioned McDonald's. There are some other big companies that have been doing a good job where it hold on Chipotle, Texas Roadhouse that are driving same store sales and traffic. We think one of the smaller growth companies that's inflected positive is Dutch pros in the coffee category drive through beverage category that should have a really nice 2025 as well. Also, it's what we're talking about the companies you like. She's cake you like as well first watch as well. I want to get some of the names that you don't actually like. One of them is Starbucks. Now, this seems a little bit contrarian when we look at the rest of your thesis. You like big chains. Starbucks certainly a big chain. It has a lot of stickiness when it comes to customer loyalty. Why are you down on this name? Yeah, for sure. We're the only underperform on the stock and it's nothing to do with Brian Nichol and the management change they made earlier this year. It was just that it added so much value to the stock at the time that we thought the value of the equity had gotten way ahead of the turnaround, which we believe will take some fairly significant time and energy from Brian as he puts together as team and then works into 2025 to stabilize the foundation and the culture of the business. So yes, a great brand that will come back again. We just think it'll take a little bit longer and be a little bit bumpier than the market expected when the stock rebounded with Brian Nichol's announcement as the new CEO. All right, Starbucks shares up just about 2.5%. By the way, I never really thought oil and coffee made a lot of sense, but that's just a side note. I want to get to one other area that you're very bullish on. It's food distribution companies. Not something we talk a lot about here on CNBC. Very quickly, what's your thesis? Why are you so bullish? What's the top pick in that space? Yeah, they're really covered primarily by my
