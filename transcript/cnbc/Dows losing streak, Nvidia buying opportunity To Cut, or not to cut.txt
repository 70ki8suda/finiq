 Tomorrow, Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Lair. What's next for the crypto industry and innovation? Plus, the push for a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Stay ahead of the market, Squawk Box. Tomorrow, 6 a.m. Eastern, CNBC. That's the end of regulation. X-trackers by DWS, bringing the closing belt in New York Stock Exchange. Love, shit, love, sack, company. Not love, sack. Doing the honors at the Nasak. The Dow finishing lower 49th, straight session. This is the longest losing streak since 1978 for the Dow andustreals. As attention turns to tomorrow's Fed decision, that's the Squawk Car and Wall Street, but the action is just getting started. Welcome to Closing Belt Over Time. I'm Morgan Brennan with John Fort. And coming up on today's show, Nvidia falls deeper into correction territory. We'll ask an analyst if this is the buying opportunity you've been waiting for or if more pain is ahead. Plus, a number of big moves in the farmers' space today, including a pop for Pfizer and a 25% surge for another big player. We're going to discuss the best buys in the space heading into your end. And in under the radar defense winner, shares of Parsons are up more than 50% this year. But will the Department of Government efficiency put the breaks on that rally? Parsons CEO joins us to discuss. And let's get straight to the market action with eye capital chief investment strategist, Anastasia and Maroso. And bespoke investment group, co-founder Paul Hickey. Welcome to you both. Another down day for the markets, Anastasia. I'm going to start with you. We've had poor breath. We've got what's expected to be a hawkish pivot, or at least a slowing pace of easing with the FOMC rate decision tomorrow. You've got sentiment and positioning that's particularly frothy. And then risk-spectering into the market around what Trump 2.0 is going to mean here for stocks. How do you see 2025? Well, 2025 is definitely a positive story. And I can talk about that in just a minute. But you mentioned some of the key indicators, Morgan, which is some of the sentiment positioning. It has gotten very buoyant. It has gotten very buoyant frothy, if you will. And so I do think naturally the market is poised for some sort of consolidation, or at least a pause in the rally that we have been seeing. I mean, if you looked at some of the overbought conditions on some of the semiconductor stocks that have rallied recently, I think we need to take a little bit of a step back and work that off. And I think that's what the market is doing. So I think we might still gain ground into year end. But going into the 2025, I do see a positive outlook. I think the underpinnings of the economy are absolutely solid. We saw that in retail sales. We see that in real wages from the consumer. We see that in the household now worth. And so all of those factors together with rate relief, deregulation, capital market activity, all of that should support 2025. Now, I do worry having said all that. That the sentiment is universally bullish. It seems like. And everybody's conviction is that it's going to be a solid year. So I do start to wonder what might be the wild cars, what might go wrong, what might we be disappointed about come January? OK, I want to dig into that a little bit more. But first, Paul, when I get your thoughts on this market here, we just opened up the hour talking about the fact that the Dow is on pace for its worst losing streak, at least based on number of days since 1978. Even as we are seeing certain pockets or corners of the market looking very, very frothy, I know Bespoke has been putting out notes on things like quantum computing and some of the crazy moves we've seen in stocks there. What does it tell you about the health of stocks right now? Yeah, so I think when you look at the individual stock level, it's been a week's start to the month of December. But let's remember that December is always, not always tends to be back and loaded. Historically, mid-month, it's unchanged on the month tends to be. So this underlying weakness is more than expected. The average stock is down 4% in the S&P 500 this month, even as the index is flat to slightly higher. So I think there's quite a disparity, depending on which way you look at things, how the market looks. So I think in that respect, it's a little bit concerning. But I do think that we're going to close out the year on a stronger note here. You just look historically, the seasonal trends are in the market's favor. The last 10 trading days of the year tend to be strong, especially in years when the market is already up 20%. Look at the NASDAQ. 17 years has been up 20% heading into the end of the year. 17 years has been higher in those last 10 trading days. So that's a pretty consistent record. And I think going ahead to the Fed tomorrow, well, in Estonia, mentioned sentiment being universally bullish or very bullish, I agree with her completely there, that there is a lot of optimism on the part of investors. But there's also near unanimity that tomorrow is going to be a hawkish Fed statement and that we're going to see hawkish comments from Powell and dialing back of rate cuts. And so when everybody's expecting that, it tends to be priced in. So that can be a positive surprise as we get into the statement tomorrow. So in Estonia, back to your optimism for 25, so far, President-elect Trump's unpredictability has been a positive for markets. Of course, deregulation will happen, but maybe he won't implement tariffs and deportations in a way that causes inflation. What if anything could cause that unpredictability to maybe shine a red light for investors in 25? Yeah, and I think you say this very well. It is unpredictable, and that's why we call the outlook for next year is constructive, but with plenty of wild cards. And what does a wild card mean? As you don't truly know which one you're going to get, you don't really know how it's going to go. For example, how fast are we likely to get tax reform? How fast are we likely to get tariffs? How aggressive are the tariffs going to be? And that is truly unpredictable. So neither investors nor the Fed should actually react to that. So we have the baseline scenario for 2025, which is risk assets should have a positive outcome. We should hopefully maintain a 22 times multiple on the S&P. You squared that with $304 of S&P 500 earnings for 2026 that gives us about $6,700 on the S&P. So that's what I think the market should eventually trade to towards the end of 2025. But throughout that, John, I expect we will have periods of volatility and investors should really think about what kind of Trump 2.0 are we going to get? Are we going to get this similar to the 2017 experience or similar to the 2018 experience? And the volatility backdrop was drastically different. 2017, the VIX was averaging about 11, 2018, the VIX was averaging about 18. So maybe we get somewhere in the middle. And so I do think investors should state pro-risk, state invested, but be ready for these boots of volatility. OK, Paul, what should investors make of the fact that the Dow and the equal weighted S&P have both done so poorly lately? Yes, so I mean, I think what you talked about in the intro, it's historic cases of consistency of declines. But you also look at what's happened to interest rates so far this month. And as interest rates have been rising pretty steadily, you've seen weakness in these cyclical stocks. So I think a lot of it has to do with interest rates here. And a lot of it has to do with concerns over the Fed tomorrow becoming more hawkish. And for all this talk about how we've heard a lot of people talking about how the Fed should take a more aggressive policy based on what could happen in a Trump administration. I mean, since when has the Fed ever become anticipatory, rather than reacting to what's going on? So I think to the Fed to take actions based on what might happen, and when we all know is a very unpredictable environment, would be foolish. And with regards to the Fed, the number one thing to think about here is not the pace of rate cuts. It's the bias. And the bias is still towards easy, a lot slower than we may have thought six weeks ago. But as long as the Fed is biased that way and not towards hikes, it's a net positive for the market. All right, Paul Anastasia, thanks to you both. Thanks. Well, let's turn now to the chips. In video, stock just logged its eighth loss in nine days and has entered correct well. Do we enter correction territory from individual stock? I don't know. But Broadcom has soared, meanwhile, more than 35% and surpassed a $1 trillion market cap for the first time after investors cheered its earnings report last week. Most shares did close about down 4% today. And joining us now is B of A security senior analyst Vivek Arya has a buy rating on both stocks. Vivek, good to see you. So I guess with Invidia doing what it has recently, raises a question, how vulnerable is Invidia in the short and medium term to the market's overall risk sentiment? I mean, Invidia is lower since the election. Right. Hi, John. Thanks for having me. I think Invidia, so he's our topic for next year. We like Broadcom and Marvel for that matter as well. Because these three companies are ideally positioned to capitalize on this demand for AI infrastructure. I think specific to Invidia, there are two issues that have been affecting it. A near term, one is the execution on the new Blackwell product. You know, the last two quarters they have reported. There have been some production issues with Blackwell that they have resolved. Then there were some delays in getting it out to hyperscalers. And I think those will also be resolved. So in our perspective, this is actually a very attractive opportunity to look at Invidia because these concerns will be short term in nature. When we look longer term and look at the situation that Broadcom mentioned that in the next few years, they could be greater demand for custom chips. I don't think that is inconsistent with the way we have part about the market, which is about 80% of the market will be merchant accelerators where Invidia will dominate, and about 15% to 20% of the market will be more custom chips where Marvell and Broadcom, I think, will do extremely well. So we think of these as very complimentary in nature. And some of the issues around Invidia, we think are very short term, and the stock is trading at a very attractive valuation right now. Zooming out a bit, we're in day two of the Qualcomm ARM trial, and ARM has been such a big part of the smartphone story, now the AI story. Is there any risk to semiconductors overall in how that plays out? Sure, so I won't comment on the litigation per se, John, but with ARM, I think the one advantage they have is that it is impossible to make a mobile product without ARM. Number two, they are starting to take a share on the data center server side. You know, we were just talking about custom chips. We have Amazon with Graviton launching chips based on ARM on the server CPU side. We have Invidia with Grace. That's based on ARM. We have Google with Axion. That's based on ARM. So they are taking more share and server CPUs. And then on the PC side, today at the early days, it was just Qualcomm with ARM based AI PCs. Next year, I think we are going to see multiple layers launch those. So VCR has just a beneficiary of this rising trend of adoption across these different parts of computing. So our assumption is that, you know, the litigation gets resolved one way or another, but the key part of ARM is just broad adoption in a variety of these end markets. Rebecca, I want to go back to Invidia here for a minute because I'm going to ask you the same question and ask somebody else on the show last week. I was speaking to a founder of an AI company that is really ground level when it comes to all this Gen AI application adoption, the LLMs and the creation of them. And this person said to me that they think that the world is much more close to being oversupplied in GPUs than everybody realizes or at least investors realize than that 2025 could be a year where you see a dramatic swing in light of that. Flash forward to a couple of days ago, Satya Nadella from Microsoft is on a podcast and he says, power, yes, constrained. Quote, unquote, I am not chip supply constrained. Is there a possibility that we actually see this shift next year? And if so, is that part of why we're seeing Invidia sell off right now and that rotation into other names like Broadcom as some investors are anticipating this? Sure, no more that's a fair point, but I think what many of these customers or partners are looking at is the situation when it comes to Invidia's Hopper product, right? You know, Hopper came out two years ago and we are just at the verge of making a crossover to Blackwell. Blackwell is just starting to get shipped and it takes a minimum of two to four quarters, right? For customers to get their complete allocation. So it's very hard to see how they are overstocked when they have yet to deploy their first cluster, right? With Blackwell. The second very important thing that I want to mention, right? Which is something that came out on Broadcom's Ernie Scholl is they are saying that we have line of sight to multiple hyperscale customers who want to build clusters that are one million accelerators each. You know, the state of the art today is a cluster that XAI is building that is only 100,000, going to 200,000, then maybe a million and Broadcom is saying people see multiple million unit accelerators that suggests that the market for training could last much longer and be much bigger than we think over the next few years. So what you said makes sense, I think, for Invidia's prior generation product, but Blackwell, they have just started to ship and that's why it's hard to see that being overstocked anytime soon. And it's back to the point I made before that it's execution on Blackwell. The day they get Blackwell out and it is shipping without any hiccups to all these customers, I think interest will come back to Invidia just as quickly as it seems to have gone in the near term. All right, Vivek Arya, thank you. Thank you, now. Well, we're just getting started on over time. Up next, Pfizer finishing at the top BSNP 500 today for the company released its 2025 forecast. We'll talk about that name and other opportunities in healthcare for the new year. And later, the CEO of Parsons, this is a stealth winner in the defense space this year, joins us with a look at what's driving the big gains for shareholders. Over time is back and two. Tomorrow, Circle co-founder and CEO, Jeremy Alair, what's next for the crypto industry and innovation? Plus, the push for a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Stay ahead of the market, squat box. Tomorrow, 6 a.m. Eastern CNBC. Welcome back. Shares of Teba farm, Sutokols and Sanofi are both higher after announcing positive trial results for their joint drug aimed at treating patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the most common forms of inflammatory bowel disease. You could see those shares Teba in particular, finishing the day up more than 26%. Meantime, Pfizer closing at the top of the SNP 500 today after releasing its 2025 outlook, which was in line with expectations. The company is saying it expects 2025 sales of its COVID-19 vaccine and drug to be consistent with 2024 levels. And joining us now is BMO Capital Markets analyst, Evan David Seagerman. Evan, good to see you. So is this reaction relief that they're basically on track and have caused? Let's see, as well. Yeah. A lot going on here. So, yeah, for sure. So we were very encouraged by the earnings guide of 280 to about three bucks per share. At the midpoint, a little above, the midpoint of that is a little above where consensus was. So the key here is, folks were concerned that we're going to sandbag guidance like they did last year. They did, and it shows that they're getting costs under control. And that revenues are also supporting some growth. I think they're still room for next year for them to beat Narees, which investors like as well. How do you factor in patent risk? For sure. So a few things. I think, you know, eloquence goes off patent in 27. Ibrans follows as well. That's there. That's why they acquired Seagerman last year. On the call, Albert Borla was talking about how Seagin could be 10 plus billion dollars of revenue, you know, additional by the end of the decade. You still have a decent amount from COVID. And they're also launching some other assets, including a drug from multiple myeloma. So they have good assets in development and being launched. There's going to be some patents, the drug pens that roll over, but they are making really nice progress. Evan, what is Trump 2.0, RFK Jr. sort of this materializing administration that's coming into power come January, going to mean for health care, especially with all the focus on PBMs, all the focus on drug pricing, focus on vaccines. So yeah, most definitely. So Albert also indicated that he met with President Electrom, and I believe RFK recently in Mar-a-Lago. A few key takeaways there. One, you know, they worked very well together in Operation Work Speed, so he has a good relationship. I think RFK could be a skeptic on vaccines, but again, HHS is a very complicated organization. I don't see him disrupting the vaccine kind of, you know, the vaccine space that we have currently. I'd also want to add, there's going to be new focus on PBMs. That was something that President Electroms said the other day, Albert Borla reiterated that, and I could see that pressure. The PBMs who saw that in the market today, which could be good for some of the bio-paramonyms taking the drug pricing spotlight off of names like Pfizer, for example. The fact that it would take the drug pricing spotlight off of the Pfizer's of the world, would it actually put pressure on them, though, in terms of prices, or does perhaps cutting out or re-regulating the middle man actually mean that they're going to make more money in the process? Well, one thing that would happen is we wouldn't see these list price increases, which these companies get skewered for. And there'd be more transparent pricing, and potentially more transparency for the patient at the pharmacy counter. Right, there's a lot of talk around high out of pocket costs driven by the PBMs. So if you see, you know, rebates and discounts actually going to the patients, that could be good for someone like Pfizer. Of course, it is always going to be more complicated, and I'm sure, you know, there's always going to be folks complaining about the high cost of drugs, but getting some more transparency won't hurt at all. Yeah, for sure. Evan David Seagerman, thank you for joining us. Thank you for having me. Up next, the under-the-rate art defense contractor that's 50% this year, the CEO of Parsons joins us with a look at what's driving growth at the company, and how the next administration, the Department of Government efficiency, could impact its business. And later, the CEO of $40 billion laboratory tech company, Agilent, joins us with his message for shareholders from investor day. Tomorrow, Circle Co-Founder and CEO Jeremy Lair, what's next for the crypto industry and innovation? Plus, the push for a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Stay ahead of the market, Squawk Box, tomorrow 6 a.m. Eastern, CNBC. Welcome back to overtime, defense contractor and infrastructure contractor Parsons has been under the radar winner this year, up 53%. But those gains came to a halt after Donald Trump's election, dragging the stock down 13% since November. Joining us now is Parsons CEO, Carrie Smith. We have you here on set. It's great to have you. Welcome with that intro. I will add a little context, and that is we have seen all the defense contractor stocks and government IT and services stocks come under pressure since the election, because there is this anticipation that Doge is going to mean compression of margins. How do you see it with the Trump administration coming in? Yeah, well, thanks. I'm happy to be here today. First, I would say our report fully is very well aligned with the Trump administration. If you look at our federal business, we have a purpose-built national security company, which does cyber, electronic warfare, space and missile defense work. And then if you look at our infrastructure business, we're very well positioned with the infrastructure bill, which was a bipartisan bill. And I would say basically on the federal side of the house, what's key is the national defense strategy. And that really has not changed since Trump won to Biden to Trump too, basically focused on near-pair threats. As far as the Department of Government Efficiency, they have three objectives, which we're very well aligned with. The first is how do you reduce cost? The second is how do you get rid of unnecessary regulations? And then the third is how do you improve government efficiency? So we actually view this as an opportunity for our company. First, if you get rid of unnecessary regulations, a company like us can move very fast. We're innovative, we're very agile, and we can get technology more quickly to the marketplace. As you look at reducing cost, we can come up with ideas like how you might privatize areas, or how you might use different business models like as a service. And I think all those objectives are very well aligned. Interesting. And certainly it does seem like anything involving defense tech or efficiency as the title, I guess, of the entity was to just is going to be in focus. You're also very big in the infrastructure business. So whether it's from a defense side, or whether it's from a critical infrastructure side, want to get your thoughts on what we're seeing with these drones here in New Jersey? Yes, I would say first, from a defense perspective, we are very heavy in that, and also protection of critical infrastructure. In fact, if you look at critical infrastructure, our portfolio is very unique because we provide cyber capabilities, and we understand the domain knowledge. So for example, how a transportation system works, how an airport might work, but we're also very equipped to protect it. From an unmanned air system perspective, we provide counter-emanned air systems. So we're basically looking at how do we secure and ensure the safety of personnel facilities and assets. We're providing support today for both the Department of Defense as well as the Department of State. And we provide capabilities, including how do you detect identified track and deter an unmanned air system. And I'd say one, follow on to that, as well as have electronic warfare effectors. So we can stop an adversary from causing harm with their weapon systems or communications. What are the biggest infrastructure opportunities you see outside of the U.S.? Definitely the Middle East. So if you look at our portfolio, we're about half within North America, and half within the Middle East, in the infrastructure side of the house. We've been doing business in the Middle East for six decades. We've been in Saudi Arabia for five decades. We have a Saudi Arabia 50-50 joint venture partnership. We're involved in almost every major project going on there today, including Neon the Line, which will be as tall as Empire State Building, as long as Long Island. We're involved in Qidiya, the World's Large Standard Tame at City. We're involved in King Salmon Park, which will be five times size the Central Park. It's quite exciting to help Saudi prepare for the upcoming events where they're going to be on the world stage, since it's 2029 Asian Games, the 2030 Expo, and the 2034 World Cup. All right, so much to talk about. It's a very big portfolio that you have, Kerry Smith of Parsons. We appreciate you joining us here on set. Thank you very much. Great to be here. Well, the Fed getting set to reveal its rate decision tomorrow, and while most on Wall Street, expect a cut, former Kansas City Fed President, Esther George, isn't convinced when it's needed. So if you were in the meeting, you would say no cut? I think I'd be crying to say no cut. Let's wait and see how the data comes in. Coming up, we'll talk about what a cut or a pause would mean for your portfolio. Over time, we'll be right back. Welcome back to Overtime. Adulant Technologies, the original HP, kicked off its investor day today, where the laboratory equipment company reaffirmed guidance for the first quarter and full year as well. Joining us now is Adulant CEO, Porting McDonald. Porting good to see you. So the healthcare segment, a lot of your customers has been challenged. How do you see your way through that? Yeah, so we're in really attractive markets, or overall total address with market is 80 billion. We believe in a goal and age of biology and science and advancing therapeutics. We see a long runway and that, and our key markets have applied as well, where we were looking at PFAS testing, has a really strong runway as well as therapeutic advancements and our farm and buyer farmer markets. So over time, we see the markets coming back slowly, what they're coming back, and we expect this to continue to 25 and into 26 and beyond. What are the most disruptive innovations you're betting on that are going to make the difference over the next, you know, three plus years? Yeah, first of all, bringing AI into the company and bringing AI to a customer's true or lab-asset management software, making labs more productive. If you talk to every customer around the world and I've visited many lab productivity is really critical, and our AI capabilities are going to be critical to make customer successful. And also cutting out science detection limits around PFAS testing or forever chemicals is going to be really important, but not only those limits, but our scientific expertise that we can get the results quickly and also efficiently. Corey, you just talked about the golden age of medicine. What does policy of an incoming Trump administration mean for that? Yeah, look, there's a lot of change going on, but we see, you know, there's puts and takes, but we see more tailwinds and headwinds. We see, of course, maybe you could see FDA approvals increasing and that would help the sector and help us also regulate regulations around PFAS and forever chemicals. That's something we see that's going to be a continued focus. And also, you know, for companies like us with a global supply chain on tariffs, we can move our supply chains pretty quickly. We have in China for China, but also we have manufacturing across the globe. So I think we need to wait and see. OK, you just mentioned China. It's what, nearly 20% of revenues. You're expecting mid-single to high-single-digit growth. Yes. Is there more opportunity or more risk in China right now, especially if you do think about the tensions between the two countries and things like tariffs? Yeah, I think what's really important is that, you know, it's the second largest twos market in the world. We've got the largest install base. What's really important is met in China for China so manufacturing capability. All our products are now being manufactured in China, which is really important. Strong technical teams that can bring science to life there is going to be really important and staying closer to our customers. There's different puts and takes, of course, on the macros there. But over time, we see it mid-single-digit growth and the agile team is ready to have our customers there. For diagnostics and genomics, did a little better than the street had expected, even though it's under some pressure in the latest quarter. Breakdown for us, what's going particularly well there? Maybe in pathology. Yeah, pathology is a very durable business, you know. It mid-single-digit growth, you know, we're in critical of the concert testing, pathology testing around the globe. We see what's really interesting is lab productivity and our magnet system is really important about it. It helps pathologists get the information quicker. So very durable business, high-recording revenue and looking forward to the future. Oregon McDonald, a vagilant. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you. Smile for the camera. Coming up, Waewaumar is turning to body cameras to combat theft and keep employees safe. But first, to cut or not to cut. That's the question facing the Fed right now. A top economist weighs in on what J-Pow and companies should do tomorrow when overtime returns. And take a look at Cheers of Airspace and electronics company, Haiko, pulling back sharply in overtime. There are about 4% right now if the company just reported fourth quarter revenue that missed expectations. Stay with us. Welcome back. The Fed meeting starts today and many on Wall Street expect the central bank will announce a 25 basis point cut tomorrow. But there is some debate on whether it should cut former Boston Fed President Eric Rosagrand, saying yesterday right here on overtime that he would dissent against a cut and former Kansas City Fed President Esther George telling Squawk Box this morning that she would also vote against one if she were in the meeting. So joining us now is SGH macro advisors, chief US economist and Fedwatch blog author Tim Dewey. Tim, it's great to have you back on the show. I mean, everybody thinks the Fed's cutting tomorrow. It's basically 100% priced into the market at this point. But the framing seems to be that it's a hawkish cut and that what's really going to matter here is the dot plot, the SEEP and the forecast for next year. Your thoughts? Right. So agreed. It seemed very unlikely the Fed's going to knock out rates at this point. So pretty much all priced in. And that's been the signaling. What really is important here is what's the Fed expects to do going forward. And I would say it's just more than just the dot plot. It's really the messaging that Paul, Chair Paul gives around the dot plot. So one place that we expect to see that the sort of the move toward a more hawkish cut to evolve is in the three rate cuts projected in next year instead of the four that's in the occurred SEEP from September. And so that would suggest the Fed was much more cautious about the speed at which they're cutting rates going forward. In response to the fact that the economy has not decelerated as quickly as they thought or as much as they thought. And they enhanced uncertainty really that they needed to do for a cuts next year in order to sustain a strong job market. Looking at all the data, do you think a slowdown in cuts in easing is warranted here? So I said to part of our question, right, is generally I work with what I expect the Fed to do being the most important thing. I would look into the first quarter and be thinking about has the labor market really started to stabilize and is it rebounding. My view is that we don't see that stabilization in the labor market, the labor market seems to be still cooling. And if the labor market is still cooling at the same time, the Fed's measure of inflation, core PCE, PCE, more generally core PCE, specifically as a guide. If that really does come down in the first quarter, as we expect as some of those basic facts move out, then the Fed could in theory have space to continue to cut. Really, it's the uncertainty, I think, going into the back half of this year, especially associated with the incoming Trump administration's economic policies, of which we really know very little about how the be impacted. Yeah, speaking of, how long do you think before, not just safe tariffs themselves, but the anticipation of time starts to show up in data and the Fed starts reacting to that? Right. And so that's a great question, because first of all, we, as far as in tariffs go, we have very few details. We think the administration, incoming administration, will be committed to doing something about tariffs. So firms right now are kind of struggling about exactly how to incorporate those assumptions about tariffs into the out there outlooks. So one sense is that if I was uncertain about the outlook, I would be more cautious about hiring, I would be more cautious about investment before committing new funding to employees in capital until I had more certainty. And so I think that's the question that firms are going to be asking themselves over the next quarter, is what's going to happen here, and really what's the appropriate way to respond? And so I think you could start to see that in the first quarter, if you don't get the sort of animal spirits that we expect to be show up and hiring, if we don't get that, I think that would be a sign that firms are saying, hey, wait a second, we have to be more cautious going into this year. And that could show up within the first quarter. I suspect if it's going to want to skip the January meaning slow the pace of rate cuts and come back to the question of should they cut again in March after they start to incorporate some of that first quarter data and some of the initial moves by the administration in their forecast more specifically. And I guess similarly, the potential impact of deportations on the labor market, you want to see if people are self-deporting, if there's a change in people's eagerness to come into the US by less than legal means. Right. And that's another place where you'd be cautious. So if you're, I would say, for example, if you're a farmer, and you have to start planting some time in the spring, with the assumption that you'll have a labor force available for you in the fall or to harvest, I would think that you'd be somewhere cautious in how you choose what to plant because you'd be worried that the labor wouldn't be there. And then you'd have to have a crop that you could do some kind of mechanical picking. And construction could be very similar. So I would be very uncertain too about what the labor force was that I had to work with going into the back half this year. And I would be worried that we wouldn't want your entire work for suddenly taking away an enemy given day. And you'd have to figure out, well, do I rehire? Or is this just the end for this operation? So again, without sort of having some real specific ideas about what's going to happen and be what kind of impacts is going to result from that, I think you're really when I look out in the back half the next year, I say, I'm not sure that my base case should change that much toward following through on the Fed's basic model that they're going to continue to normalize policy as inflation falls. But the range of uncertainty about that outcome seems to be much broader. All right. Well, we're going to have to wait and see then. And continue to be data dependent. Tim Duay, thanks for joining us. All right. Thank you very much for having me. Up next, an up close look at Lockheed Martin's new breakthrough test of its autonomous rocket launcher. And the risk of sensory wars from unmanned military systems. And some big moves for Japanese automakers today. Nissan and Honda both revving higher after reports of the company were entering merger negotiations. We'll be right back. Welcome back to overtime. Lockheed Martin recently completing its first ever autonomous demo of the high mars, driving and commanding the rocket launcher without human intervention. As you can see right there on the screen, high mars, which is used to launch attackums and girmlers missiles, is used in 20 countries, perhaps best known in recent years for its role in the nuclear war against Russia. Now, this is the first time, though, that this testing is being done and is being reported. Tim K. Hill, president of missiles and fire control for Lockheed Martin, calls this first autonomous test a breakthrough. This allows us to deploy them without crews. So it reduces the manpower requirements, first of all. And second, it starts to bring a capability of AI into these systems to allow us to deploy them flexibly in ways we might not be able to before. So you can imagine now these systems might be might be garage, or might be located somewhere offline. And we could rapidly bring them to bear any of our allies could rapidly bring them to bear without deploying a crew or without doing something in the middle of night that they might not be ready to do. So it's the autonomous systems don't care. They're ready to go 24 hours a day at a moment's notice. Now, it's early days still. But K. Hill says Lockheed will be able to deploy some of these systems in months rather than years. It's a key step, according to K. Hill, to Lockheed realizing its interconnected vision, one in which weapon systems can be flexible and operate either with people or without. This is something that's also evidenced by Sikorski, where just earlier this year, I flew in autonomous black-cock helicopter. See that video on your screen right there. But on a day when the House released its long-anticipated bipartisan roadmap for AI, a report that includes pages and pages on defense and national security, I also asked K. Hill where policy is headed. I think the policy is going to now follow. We approach this very carefully and very ethically, and we always make sure that we have complete control over any of the systems that we deploy, that we only give them the autonomy and the decision-making authority that's appropriate for the moment. So we're all learning together. Policy, I think, will evolve. But fundamentally, in the end, this is why we think it's so important to pair autonomous systems with man systems. Is that you always want a human somewhere in that loop that has the ability to intervene if necessary. And we expect that to be the case for many, many decades. Autonomy and AI continue to take on greater importance on the battlefield. They had a flexibility to use K. Hill's term to missions, more accuracy, minimizing the impact on troops with fewer servicemen and women in the line of fire in some situations. But we've also seen the issues and risks that autonomous and unmanned systems race, too, case in point, the many drone sightings here in New Jersey for the better part of a month. That's a situation with many more questions than answers right now and goes back to the conversation we're having just a little while ago on the show with the CEO of Parsons, John. Although I will say, there have been drones for a long time. But I never heard anybody talking about having seen a drone until people got worried about it. So there have been public safety drones, there have been commercial drones. Like some of the stuff we're seeing was there all along. We just weren't looking for it. I think there's a lot of truth to that. But also you've seen and you've had reports of drones. Some of them, perhaps quite large, much larger than the hobbyist drones that people are deploying from their backyards, showing up over things like critical infrastructure and military installations as long ago as November 20th. But it certainly seems to be crescendoing now. There seems to be quite a crowdsourced effort around spotting them, reporting them. And now, discussions around what to do around them. It really draws attention to the fact that the regulations around drones and also counter drone capabilities, at least here, stateside, need to be addressed. And there are a lot of questions around jurisdiction and everything else, how you can shoot a drone out of the sky, safety implications of that, et cetera. So we'll continue to cover that story as well. Yeah, it's going to land somewhere. Well, so news on MasterCard just crossing, the company announcing its board is declared a 76 cent per share dividend, up 15% over the previous dividend. MasterCard also approving a new share buy back of up to $12 billion. Shares are fractionally higher here in overtime. We'll share it ahead. Why the next time you go to a Walmart, employees might greet you with both a smile and a body camera. And another earnings mover at overtime shares of Worthington Enterprises jumping after the building and consumer products company, top earnings and revenue estimates for the second quarter. Shares are up, more than 13% right now. It don't miss fast monies, exclusive interview with the CEO of Data Analytics Platform Databricks. That's coming at 5 p.m. Eastern. Company just announcing it has raised $10 billion in its latest funding round valuing. That start up at $62 billion. It's a monster round. Stay with us. Welcome back to overtime. Walmart becoming the latest big retailer to outfit its employees with body cameras to help take on theft and combat of customers. CNBC Retail Reporter Gabrielle Flun Rouge joins us. Gabrielle, how much of this is about employees feeling safer versus just getting another clear advantage on who's in the store? Yeah, it's a great question. Part of this, of course, is to appease concerns from employees that might be feeling unsafe, especially in big box stores, like Walmart. But what my reporting has shown is that this is less about theft. It's more about promoting worker safety. It's about de-escalation. Think about you've got a hostile customer in your face. They're upset about a return. And the way that Walmart employees are being trained to use these devices, they're not always recording. When that moment happens, when they're getting more hostile, they're instructed to turn that camera on and say, hey, we're recording now. And the idea is that it'll de-escalate. It's interesting, because we had the CEO of Axon on Rick Smith on Black Friday. And this was one of the things we were talking about is that there's this big enterprise opportunity for their body cams and the software that's attached to it within retailers and other industries as well. Here's what he had to say. I'm just going to play this for you. Every enterprise has got to think about the safety of their patrons, and they need to be able to coordinate with their local police department. And because we've created this network of cloud software and sensors that connects people and police officers to their agency, we can now connect retailers, casinos, health care organizations, anywhere where people are gathering and they want to be safe. You have Walmart adopting this. Does it just, does the floodgate open and now other retailers will follow suits since they're such a trend setter in brick and mortar? Yeah, I mean, absolutely the retail industry is paying attention to this. When the nation's largest retailer, the nation's largest private employer starts bringing the body cameras to their employees, people are going to be paying attention. And we already knew that retailers were piloting this. They're trying it out. It's important to note that Walmart is in a test and learn phase. They're only deploying this in one market. They're going to see how it works. They may not deploy it across the chain. But certainly a lot of other retailers are going to be taking note. We had TJX companies earlier this year say that they are using it, but they're using it for loss prevention. It's very much a theft thing with them. My people close to this situation say that Walmart isn't as interested in theft, but of course, no matter what. I mean, the experts that I spoke to, when people see a body camera, it's one more deterrent, right? People feel like they're being watched. They might be less likely to shoplift. I can see a scenario where it's not necessarily a deescalating thing to be like, I'm turning the camera on now. So I guess it depends on how you do it. Yeah, exactly. We're going to have to see how this works out. And of course, we might see some footage that comes out from some of these things. Well, it remains to be seen. I mean, I know when a camera turns on, I tend to relax, Morgan. Because you're so used to it. Yeah, we just love cameras around here. Yeah, we just great to have you. Thanks. Thank you. Me and time tomorrow, we got an FOMC decision. We got micron earnings as well. FedEx and Nike on Thursday. So earning.
