 Weekdays at 5 a.m. be first on World Markets. First to the global business conversation. Get a jump on the investing day every day with Frank Holland. Success starts early. World Wide Exchange 5 a.m. Eastern CNBC. My mission is simple. To make you money. I'm here to level the playing field for all investors. There's always a more market summer. And I promised to help you find it. Man money starts now. Hey, I'm Kramer. Welcome to Man Money. Welcome to Kramer. I got other people and my friends. I'm just trying to help them make a little money. My job is not just to entertain, but explain how we have explosions like today after a whole week of bad. So call me 1-100-743-CBC. Tweet me at you Kramer. You short this market at your own. PURL. That's a couple of negative days. Today pretty much everything rallyed from the speculative to the scene. And unlike the last week, the animal spirits had enough staying power to finish strong. By the end of session, doubt was up 340 points. S&B game 1.2% and the Nasdaq pulled over to 1.77%. How's the pleasure? It was a welcome to the New Year rally after it looks to be a couple of profit taking days and no more. The most salient driver of this move and astonishing blog post by a fellow buddy, my Brad Smith, totally bankable, delightful too. He's vice chair and president of Microsoft. He was talking about how bright the tech future is and how his company's going to invest $80 billion on AI data centers this year. That's in pretty much anything related to AI roaring from electricity and power plants and semiconductors, especially of course, and video, the beating heart of the data center that looked like it was having a coronary just a week ago. Yes, here I am. This is called the pocket, not a minute. With that in mind, what's the gameplay for next week? This one's extremely consequential because on Friday, we get the non-farm payroll report. Now the market's been royal by a fraxous 10-year treasury bond that won't come down. Just won't come down. Fries and employment numbers need to show lower wage growth and disappointing hiring. Now that could bring down the yield and the tenure and therefore make people feel like that the Fed will be back once scheduled to start cutting the rates again. We gotta get them back in that pool, you know? On the other hand, if hiring and wages remain hot, well, then anything good that happens next week could be repealed. The labor reports that important because other than autos, housing and materials, I feel the economy may be too hot to give us what we need to push you straight slower. Now what parts of the economy are actually driving things? Well, one of them is the purchasing managers indexes. We're getting some incredibly strong readouts in these various purchasing management reports like the manufacturing one. We got this very morning. On Monday morning, we got the PMI composite index, which gives us great look at the economy. And any bull might be perturbed by still one more hot number. Tech with strong old data. You know, it's leader again. In part, thanks to the buzz around Nvidia CEO, Jensen Wong speech at CES on Monday Night Vegas. Right now, as I've stressed in my morning meeting, so for CBC investing club members, 10-20, by the way, I think we could be dazzled by the use cases for Nvidia's latest chips, especially the video component. Any company that buys the platform of GPUs and software can make a fortune from it. That's important because we keep hearing that Amazon wants to compete head to head with Nvidia. It's something, by the way, I don't even believe. Customers want cheaper chips. Amazon is trying to make them. That said, if Jensen can give his customers a four times return on investment, hey, it's what he's going to talk about. And show us how that on Monday night actual cases of how that can be accomplished. I doubt Amazon or anyone else could compete with that. And maybe Nvidia actually goes to a new all-time high. Now, we get a job opening, it's the one Tuesday, it's called the Jolts. You know what, it might give us some clues about Friday's employment number. I've been mowing over these job openings numbers, and I keep thinking about how President-elect Trump might reverse the high levels of immigration we've seen under the Biden administration. But if you deport a huge group of people and you close the border tight as Trump says he wants to, then you have to pray that we hear a lot about robots at CES. Because we simply don't have enough people in this country to do nasty quotations without jacking up wages. Robots may be our only hope. Wednesday, oh, interesting. We got some very meaningful earnings reports. I'm going to start with Albertsons. Yes, this gigantic grocery store chain was trying to merge with Kroger to create a powerhouse just so it could compete actually with Amazon Costco and Walmart. But the deal was blocked, and I think that might have really hurt Albertsons in the interim. I want to hear if there's still a lot of them from a food inflation to come. I also want to know if they've seen any decline in the consumption of soldy snacks and cookies and candy alongside the rise to the GOP-1 drugs. Cornwall Business School just put out this really amazing study. It shows a meaningful decline in the consumption of these categories, which is exactly what you'd expect. I'll follow up on this study later in the show, but anything that produced consumption by double digits in some categories is going to actually hurt Albertsons profitability along with that of the processed food companies. Then, at the close, we hear from an outfit, that you may not know, but I've followed pretty close. It's called Jeffree's. It's a Jeffree's financial group. This stock's been a total winner. Get this, it ran from 39 and changed at this time last year to $81 today, that is stellar. I think the change that the FDC where it chiefs, who's ideologically opposed to big business, is about to replace by someone with a more traditional approach. We'll mean many, many, many, many, many, many more takeovers. And that means very big earnings per share for Jeffree's, which consults on these deals. I want to hear about their outlook for 2025. It, as it will certainly infuse mine. Now, what was the Fed thinking when it talked about taking the rate cutting more slowly than we thought, if that last meeting, maybe we'll find out when we get the minutes of that meeting at 2 PM on Wednesday. Thursday, well, the market is closed for the funeral of Jimmy Carter and keep him with tradition following the death of a president. There's not a lot of corporate news of any consequence, but a recently minted IPO, Service Titan, which is software as a service company to help trades people is going to report. And I think it's going to give us a great quarter. Maybe one that is so good that it will worth be buying ahead of. Besides the Fable Friday employment number, we've got a few important quarters. Now, first there's Constellation Brands. This is the SDZ kind. It's a bedrackled liquor stock we own for my child of trust. That's been up and down and up and now mostly down. It's a bit like a bit of a joke stock. Right now, alcohol is under siege by everyone from the certain general this morning for a link to cancer to the GLP1 drugs, which blunt the craving to the, in the case of Constellation potential tariffs from the Mexican beers, Madeleine Corona, plus an endangered population of drinkers or of some significance, the Hispanic immigration cohort, that could be hassled or deported by the authorities under Trump. Hey, I know that's a heck of a list of negatives. And I didn't even talk about the healthier lifestyle of younger people are embracing or the cannabis competition. So why don't this darn thing? Simple. Constellation's views cash. It's growing and maybe the president could elect, president elect could exempt imported beer from tariffs. It doesn't deserve to be punished like this, which is why we actually bought some for the trust list week. But sometimes you have to take a lot of punishment to make some money. On the Costco, we want to hear about this gigantic brewery that they're building in Mexico. It's almost ready and the costs for building it are behind them. That could lead to a voracious buyback, much bigger than the one they currently have. I know, it's a dicey one. I don't feel good about it, but what can I tell you? Sometimes you just don't feel good before you make money. Delta reports too. I think it'll be stellar. The airlines are a change breed. They know when we're building up capacity to meet prospective demand. Instead, they're doing the best to keep capacity tight and prevent ruinous price wars. It's still the right time to own Delta, because the air traffic remains to grow Boston, profits are flowing like never before. Finally, there's Walgreens boots alliance. That's the Ailing Drugstore chain. It needs to do something, anything to reverse its forces. And now I believe, and I have tremendous faith in CEO Tim Wentworth, I don't think he's sitting highly. I think he's working on a change. And he might even have buyers lined up for some parts of the company, and maybe not all. I would not bet against this man, but it's still pretty hard to bet on Walgreens. So here's the bottom line. It's a light week, but still impactful, except that people will be on edge ahead of Friday's employment port. Still, I think you should do some buying if the market gets hammered. As we saw today, it's not nearly as bad out there as so many think. Let's go to Jennifer and Alaska, please, Jennifer. Three at Jim. Come for a call in about 80. Costco has fallen about 80 points in the last month, but it beat earnings, raised membership fees, and implemented technology to increase membership. Why is the stock going down, and where do you see it going in the near future? I'm really glad you asked me about this, because I'm very close to it. Here's what I'll have to say. One is when the stock is down this much from its height, you just simply buy it. Two is that this sells at 50 times earnings. People a little worried about that, not. And three, all those things, the good news, you see, you got the membership inquiry, you got the special living. They're all behind it, so people are saying, what is there to move it ahead? I'll tell you what there is to move it ahead. The single best retailer in the world, and that's why I want you to buy it as we order for the child to trust. And believe me, even though our basis is so much lower, I am tempted to buy more. Hey, how about we go to Monica in New Jersey? Monica. Hey, Jim Boulier from Pyrannis, New Jersey. Oh, holy cow, you said stone's throw from our old place. I gotta tell you, how's it going over there in Pyrannis? A lot of traffic. Doran, traffic is a bummer. I know. I always say that. What else? So I've been buying so far incrementally since September 22, based on your recommendation that you liked it, especially at the price of the time. My average return, about 130% now, and considering the week's and down days, you might be telling me, time to put coffee, sell out right or whole. Well, I hear somebody up that much. Here's what I say. I don't really care about the stock. I say I want you to sell half and play the rest of that. Play with the house's money. Why not do that? Imagine I bump into your premise. Maybe shopping at that wall, that wall looks like a million bucks. It should be worth like a billion bucks, but it looks like a million bucks. But here's what I would do. I bump into it. You know what you say to me? You say, hey, Jim, thank you. I live for that. Let's do it. Next week will still be impactful despite the lack of earnings and ports, and get ready to do some buy. If there's more, you get to hit and response that Friday's shop report. Watch what happened today. See, it's not that bad out there, all men are buying tonight. I'm a million to top 25 questions I have for 2025. Starting with look at how the election and work could affect the macro environment. You need to know the questions before you can figure out the answers. They don't go any sector by sector. Give me the stories that stand out to me in each of these categories. And later from RoboTaxi's to Swolfer, I'm running through the top themes that could shape the action in the most important sector of this market. Tech! I suggest you stay with Kramer.

With Frank Holland, success starts early. World Wide Exchange 5 a.m. Eastern. CNBC. At the start of every new year, I always try to figure out which stocks can work best over the next 12 months. But this year's different. Because there's just so much we don't know about. What's coming? Well, that's always true to some extent. This year, the stakes feel higher. Given that the SB 500 has put up two consecutive years of 20% plus gains for the first time since the late 90s. So rather than making a bunch of predictions about what might happen in 2025, I got an idea. I want to walk you through my thought process and share 25 of the most pressing questions in this market. 25 for 2025. Because these are the things we need to figure out in order to make good decisions here. We'll start with the big picture questions. Then we'll get some specific sector areas. That'll be after the break with the 10 biggest questions about tech coming after the following break. First big question. Does the yield on the 10 year treasury sink the 4% or rise to 5% first? Or does it just sit here in the middle? This is the most important question in the entire market. As I've told repeatedly, we've been in this weird situation ever since the Fed started cutting short raises in September. From the moment we got the first cut long race, which are set by the bond market, started soaring highly unusual. The yield on the 10 year has climbed from just under 3.6% the day before the first break. But it's roughly 4.6%. Now we know the 10 year yield peak at 5% in October of 2023. So as it headed that direction, I will reverse it and go lower. As far as stocks are concerned, I think they'll do well if the yield on the 10 year peaks out and goes slower. Even the basically sits here between 4.5 and 4.6, the market should do fine. However, if long rates keep climbing with the 10 year reaching 5%, well, it could be truly miserable for the stock market, at least shorter. Because ultimately, we'll be able to deal with higher long rates as we did in the 1990s, which is a great time to own stocks. Even as the 10 year treasury yielded a stunning 6.6%. Hey, sometimes when you're older, you can actually remember the stuff. Second, big picture question. Will the labor market remain tight? Even though the economy has swaffed in recent months, it's still very strong in absolute terms. Lots of reason unemployment remains ridiculously low. This resilient labor market has reason we could have a soft landing after the fed's ruthless series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023. While the unemployment rate has been drifting higher for the past two years now, from 3.4% in January 2023 to 4.2% the latest reading, I gotta tell you, that's an insanely low read by historical standards. Typically anything below 5% is considered full employment. So can the labor market stay strong this year right now, embedding a cat? Remember, the labor market was great during the first three years of the original Trump administration. We had 3.5% unemployment right before COVID hit and everything fell apart. Plus if Trump pushes from mass deportations more than that one later, it could cause a major labor shortage. If anything, we probably should be worried about whether the labor market will get too tight causing severe wage inflation. Still, this is something I'll be watching closely, starting with the December 24 non-farm payroll report. That actually comes out a week from today. We want continued strength to job market, but at the same time, we don't want it to get too strong because that could trigger another wave of inflation and force the Fed to stop cutting rates entirely. We need Goldilocks big time. Third question, and this is kind of a casual, what's gonna happen in Washington? With the second Trump administration taking over in 2.5 weeks, we still don't really know what the plan is. We don't know what the priorities here, or what the way we have to push through Congress, even though the markets had nearly two months to process the election results. Really, this Washington question could be 25 questions on its own. Is President-elect Trump serious about large widespread tariffs, or is the tough talk just an negotiating tactic? How serious is Trump about mass deportations, which, if enacted, would likely have an impact on the previous question about the labor market? How much benefit will companies see from deregulation? And how soon? What can we expect in terms of corporate taxes in extension of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act, which seems like a given at this point, but will Trump go even further? And considering that last question, here's a dosing. Will the bomb market continue to tolerate big budget deficits from the U.S. government? Someone argue the bomb market's already taken a tough line on the national debt given that big increase in Treasury yields over the past few months? And they may be right. But for the purpose of this tidy, 25 questions for 2025 to exercise, let's leave it as a simple, what's going to happen in Washington? Just like that. Difficult to answer, because as we learned last time, I mean Donald Trump is not a predictable president. Great for cable news ratings, but sometimes frustrating when you're in the business of making predictions. Maybe a higher cash position than normal could back in. Fourth question, and this one's key to the stop market. Will we get the robust corporate Ernie Squirt that Wall Street's been betting on? When you look at the consensus estimates for the SB 500 and the aggregate, the analysts are looking for 12.2% Ernie Squirt this year, followed by 11.9% growth in 2026. That's pretty far what? Now let me be pretty darn good. And it's a major reason why people are willing to pay nearly 22 times this year's numbers for the S&P 500. Now that's a big premium versus its average Ford multiple of 17.7 times Ernie's over the past decade. Buyers are comfortable paying up because they believe in across the board corporate Ernie Squirt about 12%. You can buy two times that percent and still feel comfortable, so 24%. But is it achievable? I certainly hope so. Via some combination, the strong consumer continues to rank in capital spending, deregulation, and international markets like China finally bounced and backed from the pandemic. Later, 24 times Ernie's to sell something, if those things happen, we can be in a shaper. Really good shape. Perhaps starting in 20th-wastings, additional tax cuts could provide another easy tailwind for corporate growth. But there are also things that could trip us on that path to 12% Ernie's worth at so much keys on like tariffs, higher interest rates, or worse, an erosion of consumer spending. We'll get some clarity on what to expect from corporate Ernie's worth in 2025 over the next several weeks. As companies report their fourth quarter results, and issue their initial full year sales and Ernie's forecast. Any meaningful disappointment in the four-year guidance will likely cause the aggregate Ernie's estimates to come in, which would be real bad news for the average, which would be paying much too high at price turnings multiple. Bottom line. Those are my four big macro questions. And those are huge, right? But this year has so much uncertainty that we're just getting started. I've got 21 more, 21 guns and little questions that go over every sector of the market. I say stay tuned to have everything break, and then money's back. Coming up, Kramer's posed some big questions about what 2025 holds for the market. After the break, he's getting curious about what a new year might mean for each sector. Next. Weekdays at 5 a.m. Be first on world markets. First to the global business conversation. Get a jump on the investing day every day with Frank Holland. Success starts early. Worldwide Exchange 5 a.m. Eastern CNBC. Like I told you before the break, rather than making big predictions about 2025, I'm posting 25 questions that we need to answer to get some clarity on the future. Earlier I walked you through four big picture questions that loom over this market, and now I've got some sector-specific ones. Going rapid fire. Through the 11 official sectors according to the global industry classification standard, that's what people use. We'll go down a descending order of performance from last year, starting with communication services, which is an amalgamation of sleepy telecom and cable companies, some tech giants like Alphabet and Meta, and media and entertainment companies. Here we need to ask if the advertising market will hold up, that's who pays the bills. We almost take it for granted to this point that ad spending will keep shifting towards digital channels, like search at YouTube ads for Alphabet, Instagram ads for Meta. The only thing that could truly throw them off their game would be an overall downturn in ad spending. I don't expect that, unless the economy takes a meaningful turn for the worse, but it's something we gotta stay carnal. We gotta watch it. Six questions. Will there be any tangible benefit for the financials from deregulation this year? A lot of people buzzing about that. The financials roar right after the election, as Wall Street's betting Trump will give us a more laissez-faire set of regulators. Still, those are all theoretical benefits now. This show we watch to see how quickly these perceived benefits from deregulation materialize. I am already seeing some small caps trying to merge that might not have otherwise done so. I think big ones are weeks, not months away. Thank you, FTC for, well, whatever, you know I might do on the FTC. I don't need to go over it. New FTC head though. Seven question. For the consumer discretionary spaces, the consumer starting to get tapped out. This one's a bit of a cop out because we've been asking for the two to three years now, right? And the answer has proven to be a resounding. No, each time. Still it's worth asking again. Now the consumers are demanding value these days. We'll get some of the first clues here over the next week and a half. One dozens of consumer discretionary companies presented the ICR conference in Orlando. We also tend to do a, you know, we tend to get a lot of pre-announcements down there and maybe some great color on how the holiday season went. I once went to that. Fantastic conference. I enjoyed myself, got a lot behind the scenes news. Question number eight, technology. Can the AI investment boom continue? I'll keep this brief because we're doing a whole section on tech questions after the break. But this has become a huge theme. And it's something we need to keep an eye on. Although we got encouraging news today when Brad Smith, President of Microsoft, said in a blog post that Mr. Swarthy will be investing equal 80 billion, 80 billion to build AI data centers this year. I say Nvidia. Question nine. Can the utilities actually meet our nations increased the need for power? I'm not sure about this one. Now the UTSR of 19.5% Lister. Thanks to the man for electricity. Multi-stata centers that are being built. I think they deserve to work, but they can't keep running unless they're able to generate more transmission capability. It's not a safe assumption. I'm not so sure. I'm concerned that consumers will have their electric bills jacked up so that the utilities can meet demand-centered needs. I think that those nuclear power stocks are getting a little too overheated. Question 10. What's the leading industrial themes would be the most durable? The sector's tough to talk about in the aggregate because it's made up of subgroups that are highly dependent on their end markets. Whether we're talking about agriculture equipment, aerospace defense to contractors, HVAC, heating ventilation, air conditioning, all sorts of industrial services providers. If I had to make a bet, I'd put my money on groups like aerospace, which seems on sale, well, years worth of demand there, plus HVAC companies, electrical equipment specialists, and really anyone saw you into the data center. But I'm less bullish in other industrial areas like Ag, not too good, defense, little too expensive. And any group whose end consumers, end customers, require significant financing given that long rates remain high. Question 11. This one's for the consumer staples. Can the packaged food goods beat the rise of the GOP-1? These revolutionary weight loss drugs make people want to eat less. And they put real pressure on the food stocks, even though not one of the packaged food operators will even admit they have a problem. I bet it stays a problem. This study just published by Cornell Business School, discussing the client and household spending on processed food, makes you feel like the packaged food guys will they don't have the horses. Question 12. We'll be all in gas industry production discipline remain as we return to a drill, maybe drill, euro. Now, we know the incoming Trump administration will be a lot more fossil fuel friendly in the Biden administration. It's hard to be worse than the fossil fuels in Biden was. But as I've always said, my biggest concern is that Trump's people will be too friendly to domestic energy production too friendly. See, if the energy industry is encouraged, bruises, as much as it can, that would crush oil and gas prices, because that happened the last Trump administration. Now, for the last few years, the oil and gas producers have benefited tremendously from the fact that they've been remarkably restrained with their production growth, managing for cash flows and profitability rather than production growth at all costs. That's discipline has been fantastic for earnings. But it's historically unusual. Can they hold back on production with a friendly white house that wants them to drill like crazy? Maybe a good edge by some of the pipeline stocks they win either way. Question 13. For real estate, what we see more retail back machines and store closings putting pressure on the retail oriented real estate investment trust. A lot of sears come on these shows, and they tell us that we should be more worried. Now, we just see some of this in 2024. Big box retail and big lots. Did you really ever go there? They declared bankruptcy in September. Many of the stores are closing. At just the end of last week, the container store filed for bankruptcy. You never understood by that one public and party see another. Been more of those slop shops? Oh, that's pretty manageable. But when we see more of these retail failures in 2025, we'll extend the companies we actually like. Why do major retailers start running in trouble to the point where they have to close hundreds or thousands of stores? I hope not, but I'm watching this struggles of the pharmacy change in the dollar stores closely. Put enough of these together, and it's a real problem for the real estate investment trust landlords. Question 14. How will RFK Jr. actually impact health care? Go-al-health care cohort just got obliterated after the election. Especially after Trump's pick Bobby Kennedy Jr. for Health and Human Services Secretary. A big time critical of pharmaceutical industry. Trump said he'd let Kennedy go wild on health. Woo. So how wild will RFK Jr. go? Frankly, I'm less worried about this than other people in Wall Street. Especially after briefly speaking with him on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange a couple of weeks ago. I hope he focuses on making food healthier rather than stopping vaccines. So RFK's appointment will continue to well in the healthcare sector until we get some clarity on his agenda. Those stocks have not been too high. I gotta tell you. Finally, question 15. Can lower price commodities see some price increases? The worst performing sector at 20.4, the only one to finish negative territory, was the materials cohort, all sorts of commodities from metals like copper and steel to certain agriculture commodities like soybeans and wheat, there are particularly low levels. And we're hoping for a construction boom spurred by lower interest rates. Well, that got taken off the table when the bond market refused to buy ball. So to see the materials group do better, we need lower rates and we also need to see some of these commodity prices start to go meaningfully higher. Oh, and China's got to come back in a powerful way. I think all of these can have an except China. And that's why commodity markets look pretty darn ugly right now. Bottom line. These are 11 of the key questions that we'll define this year. Stick around and I'll give you my 10 pressing questions for the all important tech sector, which has been the real power behind two years of 20% increases to the average. Patrick, in Minnesota, Patrick. Hey, happy New Year, Jim. Happy New Year, Patrick. What's going on? Hey, do you think any risk the Department of Government efficiency poses to the F 35 fighter programs now baked into the price of Lockheed Martin? Or do you see that falling further under the incoming administration? I don't want to own the stock because even up at 79 I'd rather own pounds here because they're figuring out how to fix this defense procurement problem. And the problem is that these companies make too much money and the taxpayer doesn't get the bank for the buck. So even though Lockheed Martin's come down nicely, it looks like it's going to fight a level here to buy. It only yields 2.7% and it doesn't powerful and it's within the administration. Richard and California, Richard. Richard. Hello, Mr. Cramer. Thank you for taking my call. Happy New Year. Of course. Same to you. Let's go out on. Thank you. I am a sports fan and a long before Ohio State blood organ in the Rose Bowl. Nike has been fumbling the ball. They got a new CEO. And I've been, I mean, I've seen multiple CNBC episodes and highlighting a Nike is a buy or at least a hold. But since I purchased Nike in the last May of 2024, it has been a disappointment. So should I continue to be really patient, which I can do and hold on to it? Should I buy more or should I just dump it? OK, now remember, we're dealing with an animal here that had changed management. The stock is going down for what the previous CEO did. My belief in Elliott Hill is unassailable. I would not have you sell it. I want to see if the stock breaks down one more time. But Elliott Hill, he is a guy that makes me want to. I don't buy. And thank you for your confidence. The answers to these questions will go a long way in determining how each sector performs in 2025. So buckle up as we find out together. Much for me to have money ahead including my breakdown of what could shake up stocks in the tech sector this year. Plus, it's a tail of two chips in the market. I'll explain and dig into new data that she said some white on the GOP-1 impact with two players. And of course, all your calls rapid fire tonight is just a lightning round. So stay with Kramer. Tonight, we're taking through our top 25 questions for 2025. And now let around things out with 10 questions for the tech sector specifically, because tech has been leading this bull market for years. So let's take them one by one, starting with question 16. How will the AI infrastructure trade evolve going forward? So far, we've seen big gains in all sorts of hardware that goes into the data center, especially in video, of course. But also, the problem, common market technology or risk in networks. Well, that changed this year. Will there be any real challenges to Nvidia GPU dominance? Will Dell and HP pull away from Super Micro in the service space? Lots of ways this can change. Even if the underlying theme maintains this momentum. You know what I'm thinking that, in videos, the king. Right, the king. But I'm also mindful that there are four kings in every deck. Question 17, which companies will emerge as the initial AI software winners? The ones that can actually make some money from it? At this point, we've got a small subset of the enterprise software cohort that's introducing AI functionality into their product suites. Now, the one that's supposed to obviously is Salesforce, which is now rolled out as Asian Force AI platform for sales and customer relations management. Service now is done the same with many back office functions. Palantir could probably make a case for itself here. Even as this valuation has gotten pretty stretched in the last few weeks, retail buyers just taken it up. Adobe might be included though, I'm not sure if they're a winner from AI that last quarter wasn't so great, but I don't want to be too dispeared here. You know what, though, my money's on Matthew McCommey and Woody House, which is another reason Mario and the stock of Salesforce.com for the child of trucks. Question 18, is the NPC story dead on arrival? Where's it just delayed? In much respect, the AI PC theme proved to be one of the biggest disappointments of 2024. Never really mature like any meaningful way, did it? But if you look at what some of the PC makers were saying lately last year, they still expected to happen just later than expected. So are they right or will the AI PC just disappoint us again? Well, they have to make it more prominent and more useful. Right now, it is indeed dead on arrival. Question 19, can the SQL portions of the semiconductor start growing? At this point, while we think we've got a tale to sending Dr. Industries, the AI part that's on fire and everything else that's languishing. So can the more cyclical portion of the industry put in a real bottom of the student start growing again? It feels like some of these cyclical chips makers, they've been trying to bottom for the last few quarters now. But they keep disappointing, like Micron, which I like so much, but it can't pull the trigger. Cell phones have got to get better before this one can get off the snide. Question 20, while in proper growth tech names still stay hot. Or will they be finally losing their mojo? Now, I talked a little bit about this last night, the quantum computing bubble. And look, I believe in quantum computing, just not the stocks that are being taken up other than Google. There are other components of this trade as well, like some small tech companies. It seems to be rallying slowly because they have AI and their names again. Can you believe that stuff's back? Some Fintech ad tech stocks, some drone related companies, a small cryptocurrency miners. I, you look, I don't like this kind of behavior. I really don't, okay? I mean, I think that it's gonna really lend itself to some. I think it's gonna really lend itself to some. I feel much better than about the entire market. People just stop betting so heavily on speculative companies with little revenue and huge losses. We saw too much of this in 2021, before speculative stocks flew too close to the sun. And we had a huge correction in 2022. So I am asking now if the unpropelled growth tech group can stay hot, and I'm hoping that the answer is no. But I get that, at the beginning of the year, we always see this kind of stuff. I just hope it ends soon. Question 21, can the legacy tech giants continue to run? We saw some big news here at LateLess, your Cisco finish up 17% here, IBM gained 34%. You know what, you could also put Dell and Oracle into this category, although I think they deserve more credit for their AI exposure. All these goodies, even HP Enterprise, you know, it's got a lot of game. Actually, I think it's doing really well. You know what, I'm also kicking the tires on Kindral, though it's running awful lot. My bad for not featuring it earlier, instead of kicking the tires, I should just be kicking myself. But we need to figure out if these companies can keep winning. If industry trade is continuing moving higher this year, I think the legacy tech cohort could become a nice safe head within the sector. That said, the legacy players need to keep generating growth. Because it's not enough just to have cheap stocks. Question 22, will cybersecurity remain on a saleable? Now, we know cybersecurity offerings have become essential staples of the enterprise tech world. You need robust cybersecurity tools, or you're pretty much guaranteed to be hacked, which can lead to devastating consequences. Thanks to that. Well, we've had some huge gains in Palo Alto, never some crowds right for the child, trust. Like I said, this group is out of saleable. Even when crowds are like at a horrible instant last summer, which not a hack, causing widespread tech outages and losing damages for the customers, it's stuck only with Lord for about three weeks for a coming right back at the buy-and-write dental, though. You know what, you can still pull the trigger now. That's how much I like it. I bet, you know what, cybersecurity is going to be big again in 2025. Just what we're out last week. We know that ATT Verizon and other telco companies have been hacked by a Chinese cyber-espionage group called Salt Tycoon. And even the Treasury Department sanctions as well as has been hit by Chinese hackers. That was really bad, by the way. So yes, I bet cybersecurity stocks keep winning. Question 23, hey, who's going to win the Robo Taxi Race? Alpens subsidiary Google remains the leader in the space for now with the WAMO. But Tesla has made some huge progress so autonomous driving since not talking about enough. We already knew that Tesla had a data advantage in self-driving cars. And it's called Nvidia. But it's simply not on the road yet, testing it's old times, vehicles while Waymo's been doing that for a while. However, Elon Musk is in such good terms with President-elect Trump that you have to believe that his company will have the advantage. As long as he stays tight with Trump, I bet Tesla's the winner. Well, the Federal Interstate Highway system and it's going to be the real battle around here. Doesn't have an edge on the Fed full interstate system. And that's going to be where we see a lot of self-driving cars. Question 24, how will Trump's trade policies impact tech? Remember, President Trump implemented widespread tariffs on Chinese imports during his first term and then President Biden went ahead and kept most of those in place in its entirety for four years. The Biden administration even went a couple of steps further. Blocking the sale of advanced semiconductor, semiconductor capital equipment products in Chinese customers, and we did share that on the show. So will Trump continue that approach? Major implications of the semiconductor space. I get input from both sides on this one. Not sure. Finally, question 25. How will Trump help the cryptocurrency ecosystem? Obviously, President-elect Trump has sealed that he's much more friendly environment for a crypto than Biden. There's a reason that Bitcoin's up over 40% in less than two months since the election. But how will Trump actually help crypto? There's been lots to talk about a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Some of the strategic petroleum reserve said we can't use it in the crisis and it's not liquid and it's not in a sole cap in somewhere. But that would likely require an act of commerce. But in past, I feel confidence saying that the Trump administration's SEC won't pursue crypto as vigorously as the Gary Genslow led SEC. You know, Genslow really was after these guys. But what are the implications of that? They couldn't legalize the scams. Wouldn't that actually hurt crypto if people lose confidence in its validity? I say stick with Bitcoin, by the way. Don't go for the others. Conversely, we know that many industry leaders have said that they're craving clear rules of the road from the federal government about crypto. Something that Biden administration has been reluctant to do. It's preferring to regulate the enforcement. That was not an unusual way. Biden did that constantly. So maybe the crypto ecosystem gets these clear rules and flourishes. In the end, we don't really know how Trump will help crypto. And we're looking forward to some clarity on that front. But I would not bet against Bitcoin. Bottom line, there you go. Those are more, that's my 25 question for 25. Now we move forward looking for answers. But hopefully you'll come away from tonight's show with a better idea of what you should be watching out for this year so you can make more informed decisions as the answers come rolling on down the road. Bit money is back after the break. It is time. Some of the light roundcrushes, right? For our course, it's him and it's talking to everybody. I sell some stuff. You know, because I'm not quite sure that my step is to get a little fly, you play it yourself. And then the lighting round is over. Are you ready? It's game down to the light roundcrushes over the 80 in New York and a. Hey Jim, how are you? I am good. How are you? Great. Happy New Year, healthy. We get really all the best first of all. Thank you. So, great. So I'm calling you about sound town, but kind of jumped into it a couple times. About six months ago, had a nice spike. I jumped in and jumped out. And about a week or two ago, I was following it. So I started moving, didn't jump in fast enough. But jumped in about 13. Took a good position. 13, it's a 20. Now you had a tape ring, the register on some of that. Here's the problem with sound town. It's just a chronic money loser. And because of that, and actually, I think if I were them, I'd sell about 50 million shares right here and down in the hole. And they could say we never worry about capitalism. Because they do us some interesting technology. But at this point, it is a short squeeze and a short squeeze only until they do that stock and make it so they're balanced even better because they keep losing money. There's a whole plan right there. And pay me a dime for it. But it's right. Linda and Florida Linda. Kim, I am so excited to be talking to you tonight. Well, here we go. Here we go. My wife's not. I just checked. She was like, not at all. She was like, yeah, call me in. So I got to take sure. Anyway, go ahead. I'm like, like, like, question concerns half me a limited, which is a stock symbol AKFM. Oh, it's so, look, and we got that huge dividend. It looks so juicy. Those are stocks that you must avoid. You got to trust me in this. You'll get a dividend or two. But those stocks are saying the dividend saying, look out below. Now we want to go to Mark and on Roy. Mark. Hey, Booey, I, Jim. Happy New Year to you. Same. Calling to ask about home people. I bought it back in. Yo, I like home people. You're Jeff and I, Jeff Marx. And we're going back and forth and back and forth. I wanted to pull it through and buy more. You remember reminds me, but we already bought something at this area. But let me tell you something. Got a head and shoulders pattern. People who's going to break down. I want to buy, buy, buy, ride into that legend. Head and shoulders problem. Now it's good. And Johnny, oh, in Missouri, Johnny. Booey, Jim. Happy New Year to you. Cindy you. I've got two tickers for you to look at. The first is riot platforms to stock up trade it over the last year. OK. Well, riot platforms, I have to go to my chief scientist Ben Stoodle on that. He points out that it's a Bitcoin minor. And you can you get a better business than mining Bitcoin? Ah, yes. OK, what else? Go ahead. That was it. Hello? Yeah, hey, let's take someone else. Why am I going to drew a Minnesota drew? Hello, Jim. Now, Drew, is that Drew? I'm in a Rick County here. You know, the Vikings are for real. Can I just get that out there? And I'm going to do that. What is it? The diddy? What do I have to do there? OK, anyway, I am with Jefferson. They got Jefferson. They got Madison. They all they need is washers. Right? They got the whole founding fathers. And God, where's Lincoln? They got the whole founding fathers. Go ahead. What's happening? Well, I'm a member of your club. And I'm a vice USW steel worker. Oh my God. Really? All right. And with all that's happening in the US, what's the US steel company now? Especially in light of today's news? Cliffs, Cleveland Cliffs did. Who are you to work for? They're good for you. The oil might still happen. I'm just wondering. I know. I was into the company. They're trying to get them come on tonight's show. Now, here's the problem, honestly. The steel stocks are the worst stocks in the market. And I think that you could buy this stock. And if you're willing to take a point or two down, then I think it's OK. But you have to accept the fact that's exactly what could occur. And that lay down was the conclusion of the lightning round. The lightning round is sponsored by Charles Schwab. Today we saw colossal buying in chip stocks, as traders flock to last year's starlings that's thought out less week. In video led the group, as usual, hopefully saw some terrific actions. Some of the beaten down zombies like AMD, ARM, Qualcomm. I think this move could last. As these companies have greater risk momentum going into 2025. But there are some chips that, frankly, can't seem to get off the ground. The potato chips, which fare particularly in a little notice, new study out of Cornell's business school that shows the GOP-1 weight loss drugs are having a real impact on meaningful one that commands attention. There's a definitive drop in processed food sales in this country. And it is being linked to these GOP-1 drugs. First and back on the middle last year, a wave of fear came over the food group. These GOP-1s from Eli Lilly and Nova Norris were viewed as grim reapers, slashing earnings wherever they went. We figured food sales would come down. Then, earnings for soup markets could get hurting at one point at the height of fear. And the analyst tried to assess the impact on aerospace and airlines before people got thin. It all got pretty darn fast-fold, especially eventually rationali return, along with buyers for pretty much everything. Now, the history is over. But maybe there was real cause for concern. This Cornell study that I liked so much took a look at news patterns. And concluded that, I'm going to quote your households with at least one GOP-1 user reduced grocery spending by approximately 6% within six months of adoption. End quote, the study has on the same quote, give it an average monthly grocery expenditure of $630. This translates to an annual reduction of $416 per adoptor. End quote, hey, that is big money for most Americans. The GOP-1 drugs also reduced food consumed away from home with breakfast spending declining by nearly 4% to dinner down to 6% fast food particularly hard hit. I think you might see something about this when grocery chain Albertsons reports X-Wenzett. At the very least, the soup markets management should have to address this report's findings. But it's the package food companies themselves that have the most of fear. As the report comments quote, companies that rely heavily on caloric dense process or indulgent foods are likely to face the clienting demand and need to reassess their product before it would remain competitive. End quote, in fact, the Cornell report directly posits sales weakness from craft times and camels might be attributed to the GOP-1s. According to the report, the food companies can protect themselves by changing packet sizes, offering spoiled portions, producing foods that are healthier and more convenient. I think it makes sense, but in the end, these companies are all about processed foods. Come on, it's awfully hard for them to change your stripes. Now, lots of investors have turned on the makers of the GOP-1s last night. I got a call from someone who complained about how it miserably Eli Lilly stock this done in large part because he bought it in the 900s. I totally get that. I know the stock's plummet to the 700s has sickened great many shareholders. But I think that these drugs have multiple benefits and they're staying power question by many negatives may be stronger than the critics think. The pattern seems ingrained already and the pain the processed foods were supposed to experience might finally be arriving. To me, it's simple. You should buy one kind of chip that's changing the world. The semi-duckers and avoid another kind of chip. Freedom lays. It's ironic. We used to regard the foods as safety stocks of the semi-duckers as high flyers, but huge downside. Now there seems to be nothing safe about the foods, but the semis, lots more staying power than anyone ever thought. I like to say there's always more market stuff in my product.
