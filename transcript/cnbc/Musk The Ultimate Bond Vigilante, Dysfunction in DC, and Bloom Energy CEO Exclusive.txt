Here's today's show A lifestyle I guess for Delta it is Scott. Thanks and welcome to the exchange everybody. I'm Kelly Evans And here's what's ahead Elon Musk is a man of many titles and now he can add one more the ultimate bond vigilante That comes courtesy of Dan Clifton He just wrote about the latest DC drama and why what comes next could be earth shattering what's still to come? He thinks Dan joins us in just a moment on top of that the Fed rock markets yesterday We're digging into the why when there were expectations that exactly this would happen and we'll also talk about whether fewer rate cuts next year means you should Reposition one of our guests also recently called this company and under appreciated AI play for its ability to quickly scale Power data centers kind of bring things online Stocks up 51% this year. It's our mystery chart We reached out to the CEO and he'll join us ahead with what he anticipates for the new year Before all that let's start with today's markets and dumb to with the numbers that are hopefully better than yesterday Yes, they are better Kelly and to your point we're green across the board We're losing a little bit momentum here, but I'll show you right now it is green But we got a lot of ground to make up remember the doubt lost over a thousand points yesterday But we were getting back a modest 140 of them today in this session So we're up about one third of 1% 49,000 463 is your level for the blue chip index the S&P 500 the broader measure at 5889 It's up 16 points again one quarter of 1% a level that some traders are watching which we breached below yesterday Is 5924 that is that so called 50 day average price on a rolling basis the simple moving average We're trying to see if we can get above that level of see if there's any kind of a recovery that could be Momentous in that in waves the S&P is at 5887 trying to figure that out the NASDAQ composite Equally so to the upside one quarter of 1% 55 points you're at 19,000 448 a couple of stocks very much going opposite directions today are both earnings They're both food and they're both consumer the best performer in the S&P 500 is Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse and Capital grill parent company garden restaurants up 15% better earnings report They raised their full year outlook and they're saying that people are coming back especially on the kind of casual Mid-scale dining side of things that's a good sign although the capital grill seeing a little bit of a tail off there But lamb western which is a food processor most well known for frozen potatoes Specifically french fries down 23% a CEO changed there as well as disappointing results and a lowering of their full year outlook Because of sluggish demand slower volumes and again some of these higher inflationary pressures weighing on lamb western So food very much in focus and we'll end on what Kelly mentioned before in the 10 year yield our bond vigilantes really back Well the 10 years showing something we're up about almost 10 basis points today We're going to the highest level is going all the way back to May of this year again with the 10 year going higher and yield Bond prices are falling you wonder whether or not the growth and inflation story and everything else percolating is Manifesting itself headstrong in that 10 year no yield. It's a debate on Wall Street right now for sure Kelly I'll send things back over to you and that lamb western I'm glad you mentioned one of the best stocks to one of the worst stocks in the last few years down Thanks Let's begin with the two top stories moving the market yesterday's hawkish pivot from the fed spooking things Investors are also keeping an eye on Congress which now has less than 36 hours to strike a deal to fund the government We have team coverage from Wall Street to Washington Emily Wilkins is on Capitol Hill with the latest there St. T. G. Stan Clifton is looking at musk's influence on policy Steve Lisbon is here with me following the feds path forward after yesterday's rate cut and Morgan Stanley's Andrew Slim And has some interesting ideas about how to position into next year. Welcome to all of you Emily kick things off. What's the latest? Kelly we are still waiting to see exactly how lawmakers want to move forward here in preventing a government shutdown Speaker Mike Johnson is huddling with lawmakers. He has been for hours trying to find this path forward on a stop gap measure And it could include a couple of different things We're hearing that the Zaster aid could be included while we are hearing that the debt limit could be included and that has been something that Obviously has some bipartisan support there are Democrats including Elizabeth Warren who say you know We should eliminate the debt limit We don't actually need it and they would be supportive of working on Republicans with it But a lot of individuals also feel it should be a separate conversation It shouldn't be something that squeezed in in the 11th hour into this government funding package Minority leader in the House to keep Jeffries you work Emily just a moment will come back to you But we're watching live as Luigi Mangioni who is facing murder charges has disembarked from the helicopter where he's just landed from Long Island Where he was flown after leaving Pennsylvania this morning after agreeing to extradition charges He does face four charges in New York two of stalking and two of murder and so again These are the first images of Luigi Mangioni arriving in New York by helicopter now where he does await further charges I will have more in that story as it continues to develop as we're watching him walk across the tarmac Where he's just landed to the courthouse and lower Manhattan Emily back over to you apologies for the interruption and Resume where you just left off Well, no, I mean it's powerful image right there But you guys over here in the house. There's been a lot of discussion about Trump trying to get a debt ceiling agreement into the spending bill and you are seeing house Rather Democratic House leader Hickie M. Jeffries pouring some cold water on that idea He actually posted on blue sky today saying that GOP extremist want House Democrats to raise the debt ceiling So that House Republicans can lower the amount of your social security check hard Pass so that could even complicate things I mean remember I know Republicans are negotiating a lot right now But anything that they agree on is going to have to have Democrat support because Democrats of course still control the Senate and still control the White House Meanwhile, there is frustration in the halls of Congress that a deal that took weeks if not months for to put together and have bipartisan agreement on Got settled so quickly in part thanks to Elon Musk's tweet campaign against it We chatted today with Rosa Deloro She is the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee and listen what she had to say about her frustration that the bill was so quickly sink I support what we did I worked very very hard Very hard as the other Appropriators did in terms of creating this agreement we lost some they lost some but we put together a good agreement that people could support and we were there just To support it but for but for president musk So a lot of frustration there as you can hear right now lawmakers They're just trying to plow ahead come up with some sort of deal and of course Kelly as soon as we have details on that We will let you know So if you could Emily based on kind of the the sense you're getting down there Would you say it's better than 50 50 odds are still less at this point that we get a government shutdown come Friday I would say it's bet it's better than 50 50 odds It is more likely that we get a government shutdown I mean remember this process takes time to come out with a bill to give lawmakers time to review it to vote in the house to get it to the Senate to get it through the Senate process At this things all take time and the fact of the matter is that lawmakers do feel kind of comfortable going into a weekend shutdown They know it doesn't have that many impacts But you are beginning to see more lawmakers actually get comfortable with the idea of a longer prolonged shutdown potentially even going into mid-January when Trump's inaugural is of course that would take a heavy impact on the economy Millions of federal workers would go without pay a number of federal services for Americans would either be curtailed or stopped So some really huge impacts there the lawmakers I've spoken with say they're still confident they can get a deal They're still confident that something can go through but the clock is taking Kelly and if we're not seeing some bill text soon It's really hard to imagine that we're not going to have a shutdown that goes into the weekend Then could even potentially go into Christmas Eve absolutely all right Emily. Thanks. So let's you get back to it Emily Wilkins our next guest says what happens in DC is potentially earth shattering and he's also calling Elon Musk the ultimate bond vigilante Let's bring in Dan Clifton of Stratigus of Stratigus along with our senior economics reporter Steve Leesman great to have you both here Dan. I'll just start with you. Why is this such a big deal? Yeah, first let's just take a step back. We were very close to a government Government budget getting past the continuing resolution It had the votes to pass with more than two-thirds majority to get through and as you started to see Opposition reading the text and the provisions that we're going through you began to see more and more conservative Enkst and then that led to the Elon Musk tweets Forget the day-to-day. I think Emily's reporting is excellent how this gets resolved. That's one story I think the larger story is that Congress has now been put on notice that they're not going to be able to sneak provisions into bills in the future that There's always going to be someone watching and it's showing that with the Trump administration There's going to be a laser focus to say hey, let's not use our hurricane emergency to be able to put your pet projects in there And I think that number one is a very very big deal You know, we use the remark Elon Musk is the bound vigilante but it's more representative of what we just went through in the process What becomes earth-shattering Kelly is that if Donald Trump who really only wants the debt ceiling Up before he gets into office so he doesn't have to deal with it next year If he's able to convince conservative Republicans who've never voted for the debt ceiling before to actually do it That is a sign not only to Congress, but to world leaders around the globe that he is in charge and really in charge And so that's something to watch for I'm not sure he's going to be successful in doing it Think that's why this morning you see I'm talking about more about getting rid of the debt ceiling entirely That might wind up getting democratic support But we have never had a clean debt ceiling increase with all Republican votes in modern history And what he's asking for is a very big deal and if he pulls it off It shows you that he's got the Republican party under his thumb although ironically I think he could lose the bond market because what is still happening is that he has a very expensive tax package wants to extend And all of this is going to cost money. We're still trying to figure out exactly how so I think this plays into the very fiscal worries The bond market has and the whole reason why musk and others are trying to come in and you know with with a chainsaw Absolutely Kelly, but as you know, we're very out of consensus right now the consensus on Wall Street is for a two-trick dollar deficit this year And the belief is that these tax cuts are going to rip open the deficit What we see right now is that the deficit is going to come down by three hundred billion dollars this year Before we even get to those tax cuts and that's not priced into the market So you're already going to see less issuance happen Most of that is being driven by higher tax revenues because the stock market is up $12 trillion this year and that becomes taxable next year And so you're going to get just as much tax revenue this year with all the tax cuts in place Then with the congressional budget office is saying you're going to have in 2026 when those tax cuts go away and what we're arguing to our clients is that you're going to have greater fiscal capacity When dealing with those tax cuts before you even Begin those tax cut discussions and I think that the markets in for a very big surprise once we get to April, May and June tax collections How fast this deficit's going to start coming down? Obviously, hope you're right, but Steve I'm looking at a 10 year at 458 and I think well It's you know the bond vigilantes on the fiscal side, you know that can't sort of buy the argument that Dan is making yet It's also some of the inflation as you look at the 10 year tips again. They were at 222 this morning We've only been higher. I think earlier this summer in 2023 and that includes going back during the pandemic So you're seeing this sense in the market of inflation now coming back into the discussion and I don't know if that's because of the rate cut yesterday But it now feels like the reaction to what the Fed tried to do and I'm not even talking about the projections Is almost this this fit of peak? I don't think you can divorce it from the projections First of all, I think what Dan is saying is really interesting It's not something I considered I will offer that for the past several years I've expected the revenue situation to improve because of inflation and the better growth numbers We've had I don't quite understand why that's not been the case at least on the revenue side Which is maintained its own the bigger story has been the spending side on the deficit But if what Dan is saying is true that's a big number of that the bond market may not have considered yet I do think what happened is the bond market woke up a little bit more yesterday Certainly the stock market did that there's two sides to the Trump administration and perhaps a real big dissonance in timing of when Jecal appears and when high it appears and I'll try to put it this way The implementation of the Bad stuff. Let's call that immigration and deportation when it comes to inflation The president can start to do that in January 20th The implementation of the good stuff the tax cuts it's going to take a little more time And as the workers way through Congress then has to get into the into the economy So you have this problem of timing of the good stuff in the bad stuff And I think what the Fed might have done yesterday. I mean sit dance thoughts on this And this is from Krishna Guhas piece who brought this up and you heard policy it as well Was the Fed did a little front running on incorporating some of the policy changes from the administration In for the incoming administration into its forecasts That was expected more in March But I think what happened to the people on the committee was I can't take a picture of this room and leave the elephant out But do you think the elephant was his incoming policies before we dive into this Do you think those policies do you think they think those policies will actually be inflationary when there's evidence that they could be Disinflationary and contractionary to some extent. I think they think they will be Listen, here's what we're going to have to do We're going to have to have a two tier way of looking at the feds inflation numbers I think the Fed believes that they will push up The rate of inflation on a temporary basis exactly in the near term So what you want to do is you're going to have to look at what the Fed says in terms of the one-year pop And see if that is continued in the next year. Yeah, I don't know about them being disinflationary. I think they will be One-time price hikes how much I don't know but look back to the first administration You and I both they ended up cutting rates by 2019 it was not inflationary I don't I don't think what you're talking about Well, I don't think what was done in the first administration Carries over to what's being considered in the second mission. I know Dan has a forecast that Mexico and Canada don't happen If that's true, we're cool. It's not a big deal China's another aspect. I don't know how he thinks vis-a-vis Europe But I think the president wants to use tariffs All right, maybe wrong about that then No, the print again, we break it apart China The billion dollar tariff in priests probably going to happen in May or June That's exactly what happened in 2018. It did not have an impact on inflation It did have an impact on margins and companies that were going to be impacted by that But I think what the market's trying to do is price in a global tariff and that seems unlikely right now And that's where you would have that bigger effect from that. I would also know Dan, I want to cut you off Dan. I ask you question if you were a committee member What would you do would you go with the this is not going to matter and not going to happen Or would you preemptively say I got to worry about this and perhaps condition the market for this coming Well, well, no again in 2018 the inflation rate was 2.2% when Trump was raising tariffs by one year later It was 1.2% you can look that up like like this is this could actually be deflationary and not inflationary And I would look at that example if he's just replicating the same ones that he did I would also look at the money supply which is beginning to accelerate which has led inflation and that is not a Trump problem Yeah, I mean I point out and are you Dan Dan? I just want to come back at you and say I believe that the things that were tariff Were things that were not in the CPI Well, you want to be a little careful there. I just say that could be true But we're going to wind up doing the same thing all over again into Kelly's point the Fed kept rates higher in 2018 And they were forced to cut immediately in 2019 they made the wrong assessment of the impact of the tariffs and the deficit They're going down that route again, and they got to be very very careful by that What the larger point that I think is happening right now is that we were expected to hit the debt ceiling on January 1st It would have prevented any net new debt issuance and it was going to be a lot of money coming off the Fed balance sheet Into the into the financial markets as the government spent down that charge or general account now you have a more hawkish fed based on the events of this week And you now have less liquidity that's going to be coming into financial markets in January all else being equal That's going to lead to higher bond yields and we're going to have to work through that So I think it's different than just saying these are Trump policies I think there's true fundamental factors happening here that are outside Trump and Trump may add a little bit to it But what bothers me about these studies is that there's no impact of more liquefied natural gas export terminals being built Once he waves the rules on building those factories the first week of his administration And we do think that those factories are going to get built and they're going to build cap X and they're going to prove the supply side So a lot of these studies tend to be one way in practice and reality they tend to kind of mix itself out We have to go in the steves head is explode No, no, no, no, I just I think Dan is incredibly smart and really thoughtful and and forward thinking which is wonderful I just don't see how the explosion and cap X from an initial basis is a disinflationary or deflationary event And I think that's one of the things the Fed is reacting to that all of these business surveys that are out there They come along perhaps with the possibility of an increase in cap X Along with the possibility of we have this continuing high productivity You could have rates would go up for that reason that would not be a Initially disinflationary long term perhaps it is We were not worried if you get true growth for productivity. That's a great thing for America And it's only when it's not productive and you get inflation that results from it that it becomes problematic itself I'm just saying that the balance here is a little bit Good and the bad is a little bit more balanced than I think a lot of people do They tend to go with their biases one way or another and a lot of people believe that Trump is inflationary He was not inflationary in his first term. He may be this time But you know if you're judging it based on the policies that he's put forward on net It's not going to be as inflationary as other things that are going on the economy right now Dan, thank you for joining us on a Consequential day on both the both sides of what's happening in Washington We really appreciate it as always Dan Clifton of strategist Stocks are recovering somewhat today after yesterday's big sell-off Which my next guest says is good news for long-term investors Andrew slimman is here on set with us now He's senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Andrew I kind of wanted to pick up on that discussion. We are just having though because you also have a take on House stocks or behaving and the ones where we're seeing weakness are the ones where they're responsive to some of what's happening in Washington I have to agree with Dan. Sorry Steve. Oh, which is if you look at the stocks that would would be hurt by Terrace another words they have high Products coming out of China. They're not doing that badly the stocks that are doing badly are the ones that would that would be hurt if they're a big cutbacks and federal spending The doge yeah, that IT consultants the you know the the the the the the the fed obviously the defense companies more those Then companies that produce a lot of their products in China like retailers It retailers. So I think it's an interesting commentary that maybe the market is telling you that people are overestimated Terrace, but maybe they're underestimating doge So one interesting don't forget market start rallying in mid-October Trump stock start rallying in mid-October. Oh, yes, the market Accuately predicted the election. It's been ahead on that. It's it's maybe looking around the corner now The head of the National Retail Federation also told CNBC this week the he thinks retailers have 40% less exposure To China now than they did during the first administration sketchers. There's been some of these individual examples where they're trying to get ahead of this a little bit I just wonder could this next round actually go to stocks or places that we don't anticipate You know, well, they look different is it maybe it's less about the retail supply chain and maybe you know is it tech as it chips is it that's a thing? We haven't seen that yet I'm just watching that kind of the consumer product companies and they have really been hit as much as I would have thought and versus boy these kind of government You know companies that have high percent as their revenues coming from the government. They're really been hit hard And yet it's hard to see that if you follow that out and say okay, well the defense companies We really think there's they're not going to have a tailwind and the look at what's going on globally Do we think the you know those who are contractors for instance? I mean the last time we've seen pressure on government employment. They've done more contracting at the end of it So I can't quite reason through some of those moves either yeah So I don't know how that fits in for you because you've were very bullish this year and correctly so into what you foresee for the markets overall Well, it's you know, it's very interesting I've spent the last couple days in New York talking to advisors and the who invests in our strategies and you know last year or a year A two years ago they were lamenting to me that all they could do is have their all clients want to do with by treasuries One year treasuries in money market and I come to see you and I'd say Kelly yes People are too bearish the pessimism is rampant and now those advisors are nervous Because their clients are calling up saying I don't even fart coin or something exactly. I want speculation and the reason why advice was a nervous is that reminds them of 2021 and what happened in 2022 all those thoughts got destroyed So to the extent that you have sell-offs like yesterday that reminds people be wary of what you're doing here I think that's really healthy for this market because there was too much speculation You know, we talked about value growth. Yeah, since July the more risk you took the better you've done That's not a healthy that's not a healthy thing so I but unfortunately it doesn't take one You know one pullback people will step in and buy so that it takes multiple shots I'm not bearish. I just think that you have to be aware of the fact that I'm not coming to see you say hey, it's I'm it's low on the over here in the bearer on the bulls cap It's getting more crowded now. I'm hearing a lot of people that were previously bearish now. They're more more She gets me a little bit more. I have a comment in the question. I want to add the first comment is I don't know what happened to conservatism when you used to say well if you put a 20% tax on something it's bad for it If that's true we should if that's not true. No, we should tax the wealthy a lot more Well, I have no diminishing to work effort all of a sudden we're gonna put lots of tariffs on it It's not gonna matter. Oh, that's my comment you can comment on if you want the second question. I have is this Yesterday think about being out on the water and you had the wind at your back and all of a sudden the wind shifted How much of a headwind now to the stock market is the federal reserve potentially? The key difference to 2022 Is the fed was rate you know raising rates now. They're just gonna go slower but but that's still that's still an op Good time to be invested in equities, but we need more volatility to remind people that you have to control your risk And I don't I haven't seen that you know, you know better part of this year so far So I think that's healthy for the market the rethink has been as follows post election From the from the before the election to the peak we're up 6.58 percent of the S&P As we speak right now, hold on you my glasses to get that last digit 3.18 so we've lost oh, I don't know about half of it right where's the right value? That's not the key date okay the key date is the July date when the fed said we're going to be cutting right That's when risk came back aggressively into the market and that's the thing that you know it has has Is screaming okay, so that July incompered or or in vision to hold series of rate cuts Which you're now I don't know in fact one of the things spoken if you have that December 25 contract fed funds contract The market can't even get its brain around having two cuts next time. It's got one and a little bit One in like 30 or 40 percent of the second cut deals in but I would argue Steve that if the fed had said Hey, we're just cutting cutting cutting next year and you have seven trillion dollars hitting the money market And you have Trump pro growth policies, you know my head would explode going oh my god This is going to be a great year and that's going to ball be over and we're back to 2022 Right, so you think they know that if they had talked about more cuts They would have really overly juice-finished exactly so slowing cuts actually extends the bull market Do you think they come back in and do these? That's your job. Well, no, but Here's the interesting thing was the question that I met the comment about earlier, but was the timing thing You could get tariffs and deportations next year And not tax cuts until 26 How do you play that? I don't you know that's that's the economics. I'm talking about the stock market I'm talking stock market. I look at stocks that have underperformed Since Trump election that are doing very well I mean financials ran up and they've run down the only thing that's been consistent is these very speculative kind of what I call junk growth stocks That's the only persistence until yesterday. What's junk growth? So companies that aren't learning money Rocket chips quantum computing rockets EV AI, you know all this stuff right that there's been too much speculation About the same people that only want to buy treasuries a year ago Isn't doesn't that ring true Andrew? Thanks for joining us as always really appreciate it Andrew Slimman from Morgan Stanley. See you. Thank you as well. See please man Let's talk about one other knock on effect. We've had from yesterday's cut is that mortgage rates are surging Diana Olaq has the details Diana Well Kelly after a 21 basis point jump yesterday following the Fed meeting the average rate on the 30 year fixed moved even higher today To 7.14 percent according to mortgage news daily the latest low was 6.11 percent on September 11 So for somebody buying a $400,000 home with 20 percent down on a 30 year the monthly mortgage payment today Principal and interest is $218 more than it was just back in September and that low September rate was why existing home sales in November rose nearly 5 percent from October The count is based on closing so contracts signed in September when rates were low and October when they moved higher But rising inventory helped on the margins the supply of homes was up nearly 18 percent from the year before still historically tight though Pushing the median price in November to $400 6,100 up nearly 5 percent year over year And on all of this you can see the home builder stocks taking it all on the chin the building ETF off close to 3 percent Lanar also off today 6 percent after reporting disappointing earnings and guidance yesterday It's going to be a rough start to the new year Kelly at this level Finally, we're finding out where that home building sector that had been so strong the stocks at least are are now really feeling the Section it's seven. It is you're right absolutely above that level Diana. Thanks for now. We appreciate it Diana. O'Lick coming up Norwegian cruise lines are riding a three month win streak up 40 percent in that time 40 percent now upgrading their fleet to meet growing demand We'll check in with the CEO exclusively after the break about that and their newest line of guest experiences We're back after this at the exchange CNBC has quick and easy to understand business news updates at the open midday and close every weekday Markets money and more from Wall Street to Main Street. I'm CNBC's Jessica at Ingrid follow and listen to CNBC business news updates wherever you get your podcasts Welcome back. It's been real smooth sailing for the cruise stocks this year the major players riding three or four month win streak lately as well Royal Caribbean's up 76 percent since Jan one little different story for December with Carnival Royal and Norwegian lower on the month though Cebu Modi is here with the closer look Kelly it's the best performing sector within travel even with a small pullback that we've seen in December It's been an incredible year for the cruise operators check out Royal Caribbean on pace for its fifth straight quarterly gain up About 75 percent to date while Carnival has gained double digits in the past three months higher by 40 percent this year As we await quarterly earnings tomorrow and then there's Norwegian cruise line up another 30 percent in 2024 about 25 percent Still outperforming the benchmark with more capital Into use Norwegian is investing a lot of money into upgrading its current fleet of ships and bringing two new ships to the market as demand continues to grow For new cruise experiences still seen as a cheaper than your average hotel vacation Which is incentivizing americans Kelly to book more trips and that seems to be outlook for 2025 a lot of traveling coming up SEMA come on over for the C-suite view on the industry we're joined by by Norwegians CEO Harry summer Harry it's great to have you here welcome Thank you for having me so we'll be on while we've all been focused on post election and all this drama going on and all these stocks and crypto that are flying I mean you guys have been part of this party, but maybe it's not for policy reasons. Maybe it's not for you know federal reserve reasons Is it just good old fashion demand? Yeah, I think the case the marketing message that we're setting out into the consumer world that cruising is a wonderful vacation experience for people of all ages is really resonating You know, especially in a world where the alternative options around hotels perhaps the experience isn't quite as good as it was back in 2017 2018 2019 cruising is really taking a step up great value great experience for guests and consumers are flocking to it Did you guys also partner with the hallmark channel? We had the the brand officer on the other day and they said that that's We had a whole mark like Christmas movie cruise that cruise sold out at like 15 minutes So we do another one next year. It was a wonderful wonderful wonderful experience. I'm thinking of all the podcasters out I'm thinking like everyone could have their own cruise You know, we actually run a division called six man where we do about 25 or 30 of these experiential cruises each year whole mark We have like the Savannah bananas the baseball to you mod. We have all different types of singers dancers things like that We've an electric dance music cruise. It really is well received tremendous value and tremendous experience for our guests Speaking of new experiences Harry We've seen one of your big competitors royal Caribbean come out with two new private island experiences They have a new beach club that is also hitting the market in 2025 I wonder what you make of the investments happening not just into ships But actual real estate and what Norwegians plans may be on that end So yes, get gets absolutely valued the destination experience in Norwegian cruise line Also has two private islands. We have one in the Bahamas Greatster K and one just off the coast of Belize Harvest K We continue to invest in those islands as well perhaps not as noise at least our friends did But we're absolutely upgrading the guest experience. We just invested $150 million in a new peer greatster K we're going to be building out other amenities over time as well It is one of the highest rated ports that we have in the world We're going to bring something close to a million guests there Once it's fully built out in 26 We're very excited about that. So you're out look clearly very strong going into next year We're in this unique period of time where demand is sort of outstripping supply There's still a low supply of cruise ships on the market but at the same time All of the major players including Norwegian you have new ships coming to market in next 12 to 18 months Are you worried that it's going to get too crowded? I mean one of the fundamental Things that that is as a great tailwind for the industry is there's only three shipyards all based in Europe That can build ships. So we're inherently constrained that we can't get more as an industry More than five to six percent capacity growth each year compare that to hotels where there are tens of thousands of hotels being built around the world every year It's really a tremendous tailwind for us. So we can focus on the right ships and get great amenities to our guests We believe the demand is going to far outstrip the supply for years and years and years to come I guess that's one great job out there, but you know having a shipyard kelly there's only three that help Build these new Customize ships, you know one thing we're also looking for to next year of course is understanding what president trump elects president elect trump's policies will be hairy He's been seen as an ally of the cruise industry when I think back to 2018 But have you had discussions with him and his transition team and what are you asking for? You know, we we have not had any substantial discussions with the trump transition team yet You know quite frankly we were very happy with cruise policies and cruise demands in the trump administration But quite frankly we were also happy with the with with the Biden administration policies as well You know, we seem to have an underlying product that does well on both the left and the right in both camps And we're going to continue to focus on the consumer experience as long as the consumers stay strong I guess Harry thank you. We appreciate your time. That's Harry somers of Norwegian cruise line. Kelly. We got to get you on board I yeah, it's just the I still still have it. I don't want to say never Harry cover your ears But you know, I'm in the kind of you guys come anytime you want We got you got my even sleep for you on our nc of ships. They're beautiful. SEMA convinced me have you done it? I've done it many times. Yes, it is a very unique experience with the kids no not yet. Yeah, yeah That will be a new opportunity Well, we have two new ships coming out next year. Maybe you guys want to come join us. We'd love to have you They offer babysitting. Harry. Thank you so much. Harry summer. We appreciate it. SEMA. Thank you as well SEMA Modi. Let's get to Tyler now for a CNBC news update I'm Norwegian by the way, so there we go All right North Korean hackers have stolen more than $1.3 billion in crypto currencies in 2024 that according to report today from blockchain data platform chain Allisus about that which said it was over half of the total 2.2 billion stolen from platforms this year The report also found digital thieves linked to North Korea use sophisticated methods such as taking advantage of remote work vulnerabilities the FAA closed its safety review of southwest airlines and found no significant safety issues the agency Opened that review back in July after a series of close call incidents Including one where a flight flew at a very low altitude over Florida southwest said there was nothing more important to the airline Then customer and employee safety And the National Football League announced today a new additions to the upcoming probo Probo skills composition in February Some of the challenges new this year a game show that will test players on their knowledge of their teammates and a punting contest Can't wait for that, Ellie. I always enjoy watching the probo. Yeah, well, I don't really. I like the contest stuff the competition I need that the probo is just kind of not the game flag football with pads Like the dude who like a bench press competition. Yeah, I have a way from one. Yeah, it's good stuff See it a bit Coming up in video is at risk of snapping a four-month winning streak But our next guest says we're in the midst of a paradigm shift in AI that could have big consequences for big tech. We will get into the details next CNBC has quick and easy to understand business news updates at the open midday and close every weekday Markets money and more from Wall Street to Main Street I'm CNBC's Jessica at Ingrid follow and listen to CNBC business news updates wherever you get your podcasts Welcome back in video is down 10% since reporting strong third quarter results But CEO Jensen Wong warmed up warm of some near-term supply headwinds for blackwell chips that could allow competitors like Broadcom to move in My next guest also sees opportunities for rising players of a different kind in the AI space So there's paradigm shift from this brute force scaling to more efficiency and innovation Joining me now is Chathen Pudagunta. He's general partner at legendary VC firm benchmark CNBC's tech check anger Deer Jabosa is with us as well Chathen and Deer Jrood. It's great to have you both here and Chathen I would be really curious if it's getting more active in the VC world You're starting to see kind of more smaller Companies on the forefront of AI coming through the office How what's driving that what kinds of things are they up to and how might we expect Um them to affect kind of the AI world in the next 12 to 24 months time Absolutely. Thank you for having me um as benchmark we're primarily focused on investing in seed and series a companies and in the last six to eight weeks We've seen a tremendous amount of innovation especially at the model layer and then for the last two years at the application layer taking advantage of all the advances in the AI models specifically specifically what's happening at the model layer is as we move into a inference time or a test time compute paradigm You're seeing a lot more advantage To entrepreneurs and technical founders that are able to push to the frontier with algorithmic innovation So for the last two years a lot of this investment has been with billions and billions at all ours of capex and um Essentially scaling to get advantage on AI and now we're starting to see a lot more on the algorithmic side Hmm do you're to build on this if you will what else are you hearing in terms of the shift that might be underway So I think to break it down there's been two like kind of major phases in the generative AI race What Chathen's talking about is that pre-training or training phase where the technological advancements were sort of exponential Each large language model whether that be from chat gbt Gemini Cloud for manthropic they were getting exponentially better each time But now there's sort of maybe an acceptance that we've hit the scaling laws There's not enough data to continue the pace of these advancements So it brings us to a second phase which is post-training or inference and this is very different You can do more on the existing models Which is what I think Chathen is referring to you get more applications We start to look for those killer apps next year where we're building on use cases on the technology that has already out there So in that sense you see the focus go from hardware, Nvidia, GPUs to software and potentially you know much smaller companies That are more investible for vcs versus mega caps with billions of millions of dollars on their balance sheet to invest in You know a company that may be only one or two or three people building on top of the existing models and being able to do a lot more Part of that too is you know the rise of open source models like meta's llama it enables Entrepreneurs new startup companies to sort of challenge the incumbents because they can get access to the frontier models in a very You know specific vertical to compete and maybe even create a better product Chathen can you give any examples of what you're seeing and also you mentioned that you're kind of very early on stage investor So it could be a while before these kind of companies hopefully come to market That's absolutely right. I think on the application layer I'll give you a very specific example of a company named Sierra where we were lucky to be involved in from the formation led by former co-CEO salesforce preteller They started the company in early 2023 and what they're doing in terms of revolutionizing customer service for enterprises is simply remarkable And so they're leveraging not only their own proprietary technology and models But also open source models and also models from the latest model companies Um, and as a result the applications that they're delivering are not just incrementally better than SaaS applications It's a completely different experience and what they're doing is not only consuming You know software bits and making workflow more efficient as was generally the trend in software for the last decade plus What they're now doing is automating so much of the task itself that That an enterprise could simply just say we're going to outsource its entire function to this application And the application not only makes the company better But it also makes the underlying business much better and the consumers that are dealing with that That business now have a much better experience every day. So think of This Sierra AI agent if you will delivering the best customer service agent experience Every time replicated an infinite number of times And that's an experience that was previously not possible without AI That's really interesting especially as a customer experience skeptic myself I know we have to get 15 second answer. I mean he came from Salesforce The street goes back and forth and whether SaaS is going to be totally disrupted by this or not as currently feeling kind of bullish on it But it doesn't sound to me like you'd be very bullish on these existing software companies I think existing software companies have locking in the sense of like their data But I think there's a ton of opportunity for these new startups like Sierra like Levin X like level path And many others that are going after large incumbent markets with this AI first approach And they're being accepted and pulled by customers today Unlike we've ever seen in software over the last two decades And we know what that means For potential implications Chathen thanks for joining us really appreciate it today Chathen Pudagunta dear, thank you as well as always dear, Jibosa Coming up we'll speak to the CEO of a company powering all of this AI But first college football playoff start tomorrow and ahead of the action CMBC has ranked the 75 most valuable college athletic programs Will reveal which school tops the list next Welcome back to the exchange the big 10 and the SEC dominate the college football playoff rankings And those conferences also top CMBC's new list of the most valuable college athletic programs Our senior sports reporter Mike Ozanian is here with more mic Hey Kelly good to be with you as we look behind me here We could see the most valuable college athletic programs are typically those school with the best football programs Those that are in the college football playoffs and that's because football dominates the TV ratings in the pros and college and TV money is the biggest single source of revenue for college athletic programs In fact, if you look at the top of our 75 most valuable athletic programs list It's dominated at the top by SEC and big 10 schools because those conferences get the most amount of money for television And that gap is expected to widen greatly over the next 10 years between the SEC and big 10 at the top And the ACC in the big 12 at the bottom and that's why our SEC schools and big 10 schools are much more valuable than the ACC And pack 12 or big 12 schools. Yeah, don't talk about the pack 12 my husband's still really from From everything that happened with UCLA and some of the other schools Mike You brought up an interesting point. Let's compare these valuations to what we know about pro sports valuations Because as the money comes pouring in that's what is going to be top of investors minds. Yeah Exactly and we expect this to happen in some time in 2025 Private equity to move in here the colleges need the money all the NIL spending now name image and likeness for actually They're trying to shake down boosters and they can't even keep up even at the big popular schools Yeah, Larry Lson and his wife kicking in some money so that top rated high school quarterback went to Michigan and sent an LSU But these programs in general are valued about four times revenue Contrast that with the pros where it's basically eight to ten times revenue more risk here more uncertainty How are they going to deal with title nine? How are they going to deal with their non-profit status Exactly how much money is going to go to the athletes those types of issues have to be settled But private equity wants in and these top colleges Kelly want the money What was it Ohio State number one at one point what one point three two billion War programs worth at least a billion Kelly crazy Mike. Thank you very much bringing this chapter to us Mike Ozanian and our mystery chart today was bloom energy the shares are up more than 50% this year Thanks to a more than 60% gain since november when they announced American electric power will buy their fuel cells to power data centers Morgan Stanley analyst even bird put bloom energy on our radar saying it's an under-appreciated beneficiary of the rapid growth and data center power demand Globally joining me now is create kr. Shreedhar. He's the chairman and CEO of bloom kr Everyone suddenly wants to hear about your company welcome Thank you for having me. What's your key innovation? How did you get to be bloom? You know we always said There is going to be a future where the digital economy needs digital electrons What do we mean by digital electrons? They need to be reliable They need to be clean and you need to provide abundance of them Right where you need to use the power so the power needs to be generated Where the power needs to get used as a addition to transmission distribution You see the amount of highways that bring Electrons which is the transmission the high voltage transmission This country has about 250,000 miles that is all the way from earth to moon If you were to think about that's the distance now As these large data centers require significant amounts of power If you can generate some of that power right where you need it You can reduce the congestion on those highways and we are able to do that reliably and cleanly and future proof it for zero carbon one day So when I see fuel cells I can't help but think of elan musks Derockatory term for them as full cells that was years ago to be sure and this is probably a different application But um do you think there's been a tremendous amount of growth in this space that is now and just kind of talk to talk through the the science of it Why is he wrong? So the science of it is very simple You are going to require a molecule and convert that molecule to electricity There is no more efficient way to convert A molecule natural gas to electricity Then a fuel cell period, okay, that is science that's technology number two If you can generate that power where you need it Then you're not losing transmission distribution efficiencies and you're not investing in capital for that number three Because it is on site. It is lot more reliable If our hospitals if our data centers cannot afford to lose power transmission distribution In a climate-changed world where hurricanes and flooding and earthquakes and wildfires happen That's not the best way to do it. This is a solution against that so it is a perfect complement To the transmission grid that we have so we need all of the above and the most important thing Kelly is The world needs a lot of power. This country needs a lot of power for us to be the number one AI leader And we don't have enough power and bloom is able to supply that now Today very very quickly your customers include we mentioned AEP also Equinix Intel home depot caltech So in the very limited time care that we still have you mentioned the tremendous power needs that we do have That's why your your name is on investors radars your PES at about 55 times How much more quickly can you bring more power on
