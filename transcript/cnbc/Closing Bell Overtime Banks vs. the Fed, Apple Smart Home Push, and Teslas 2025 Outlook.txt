 It's CNBC's big January with CES from Las Vegas, biotech and pharma at JPM Healthcare, the World Economic Forum in Davos, and the first Fed decision of the year. Start the year ahead of the game, CNBC. All right, that's the end of regulation time. The Council of Autism Service Providers, ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange, as you'll see in there. The little St. Nick Foundation, doing the honors at the NASDAQ Market site as well. The market leaving a nice gift for bullish investors on this holiday, short and trading day, the Dow extending its winning streak to a fourth straight day. Yes, and P500 in NASDAQ, higher for a third day in a row. That's the score caught on Wall Street so far today, but the actions just getting started here on the show, welcome the closing bell over time. I'm Dominic Chiu alongside Leslie Pickard, John and Morgan, of course, are off for the holiday today, Leslie. Every sector in the green today led by consumer discretionary Tesla driving that sector higher again. And coming up, former Tesla board member Steve Wesley on the outlook for the EV maker under the incoming Trump administration. And fun strats, Tom Lee on whether today's market gains are the start of a year end rally. All right, let's break down today's market action with a host of different voices on this. Jose Rascal of HSBC Private Banking and wealth and Steve Sosnik of Interactive Brokers as well. If you take a look at the market so far today, this is nice. It's a feel good at least going to the holiday week guys. And maybe Jose, I'll start with you. Do you feel as though this is a rally that can carry on for the next few days into the new year in that so-called Santa Claus rally period? Yeah, yeah, look, I think if you look, we got through a lot of noise in the last couple of weeks, everything from potential for government shutdowns, debt ceilings, et cetera. We've gotten through a fair amount of that. I think now people are going to look ahead, ask the holiday season, earnings begin pretty quickly as we turn the calendar page. So I think the market is going to start to look there. And no question, you could see some further downgrades and earnings expectations. But remember, for fourth quarter, we're looking for some pretty strong double digit gains and earnings still and going into 2025, according to facts that we're looking at 15% for earnings next year. So, and the most important piece from my perspective, Dominic, is everybody talks about the broadening out of the market, is if you look at earnings gains for the Mag 7 slowing, Q4 this year from 24 to 18% fourth quarter of next year, where is the forgotten 493 going from 4 to 14%. So more than triple, almost quadruple. So we're pretty excited about the potential for a market broadening even with slower fed easing. Remember, in the 90s, the Fed funds rate averaged 5.4%, and inflation went from one and a half to three and a half. So we think we're in a pretty good spot. You know, Steve, I would venture to say anecdotally, based upon the number of folks that we talk to at CNBC, that it's become consensus, that the fourth quarter and even beyond will be good for business fundamentally speaking in terms of earnings, revenues, and everything else. Maybe margins for these companies. The fundamentals are there, but we've seen a momentum shift at least a little bit to the downside since the election rally, post-election rally. Is that something to be worried about? Hi, Dom. Yeah, I mean, you know, using the old adage, it'd be a little bit fearful when others are greedy. I think right now, this is a very greedy environment, and there's nothing wrong with that. I'll quote it buff it. I'll quote Gordon Gecko, greed is good. But, you know, and particularly when you have light volume period like now, the momentum is very much in command. But looking forward into the coming year, let's put aside what may happen over the coming days, which is probably just more momentum trading unless there's something to upend it. What Jose just mentioned are some very, very optimistic numbers priced into the market. So this is my issue here. When it's all priced in, you need something even better to surprise the market. We, you know, this is already in the price. And so as you get into later in January, you have the inauguration on January 20th, which by the way, is Martin Luther King Day, so we're closed. And then you have earnings season, you know, basically coming shortly thereafter on its heels. We're going to have to here, we're going to have to deal with the potential for tariffs, the potential for immigration policy changes. And we also really need to listen very carefully to the guidance because any slip up in the optimistic numbers that Jose mentioned are already priced in, that can cause some trouble. So my feeling here is you don't want to fight the tape, but you definitely want to consider ensuring against some of the hiccups. Jose, do you agree with that notion that a lot of the good news is potentially already priced in? And if not, what do you see is the potential catalyst in 2025 that could drive that upside that you're predicting? Well, I totally agree with Steve. A lot has been priced in, but if you look at the expectations for earnings for next year, 15% from April to now, the Fed started easing. We got a sweep, a red sweep in the election. So that's all behind us. And earnings are still 15% for next year. So I agree with him that some good news is priced in. I would argue not all of it. And you have to keep in mind, now the market just priced in, the fact that the Fed's going to ease more slowly because they think inflation's going to be stronger. Next year when you see that tech deflation really begin to hit, when you see with a strong dollar, you're going to see imported goods prices. And don't forget China, the economy looks weak. So they're going to dump a lot of products here. Forget the tariffs. You're going to see the starting prices probably not go up and with a strong dollar, it's going to be even more pernicious. So I think you're going to see some downtrend in inflation next year that I don't think the Fed is anticipating. They have the inflation rate going from 2.1 to 2.5. That sounds a bit pessimistic from our perspective. And so I agree with Steve, we're doing some volatility, no question, and a lot of repricing, and a lot of volatility next year. But we still think the potential is pretty strong. And remember, as my mother taught me when I was a child, you always pay more for quality. And so therefore multiples are not cheap. But look at the inflow of capital. And our clients at least around the world, number one overweight for them remains the US well into 2025. That's a good advice for those doing their last minute, shopping, gift buying this season. Jose and Steve, thank you both. Appreciate your time. Thank you. Mary Christmas, happy holidays. Today, Bank Industry Groups filing a lawsuit against the Federal Reserve over the stress test process. These tests, they've been in place since right after the financial crisis to see how the nation's largest banks perform in essentially a pretend economic shock. And then the regulators set each bank's capital requirements based on the results. Now, today's lawsuit takes aim not at the test themselves, nor even the requirement that they hold additional capital as a buffer against future crises. This case focuses on the process itself. The lobbying groups say that each year, when the Fed puts out its hypothetical economic scenario for the tests, they should open it up to public comment. Additionally, the bank group said the models that they apply the results of the test toward how much excess capital a banks must hold. Well, they're not publicly disclosed, but they should be, according to the industry. And the industry has become increasingly litigious against its regulators this year, suing them over new community reinvestment act rules, plus a recent lawsuit against the CFPB over overdraft fee limit rules. And the industry had waived taking them to court over a Zell probe as well as Basel III, if it were to be enacted. But the Fed seems to be in agreement that more transparency is needed in this stress test process, putting on a notice just yesterday afternoon that it was considering major changes that would allow banks to comment on the models it uses, but the industry opted to stew anyway. So we'll get a better sense of why this is later this hour with Gene Scalia, who co-heads the administrative law and regulatory practice it gives and done and is representing the plaintiffs in this important case. It's a big discussion we'll have later on the show. All right, so it's not the only thing banks in focus today shares of American Airlines are under pressure, although closing well off the lows of the day. This is all after the company temporarily grounded flights because of a technical glitch earlier this morning. And CNBC's Leslie Joseph's joins us now to explain what exactly happened and the quick rebound that we saw from those technical glitches. Very lucky with the rebound. I think that's what he's traveling. Very busy travel day, although not the busiest of the holiday period. So what happened was there was a piece of software. So airlines rely on a patchwork of software of varying ages, sometimes they're decades old. And this one piece that provides data, I think weight and balance for an aircraft failed. And when that happens, the planes cannot leave the gate. So what the airline did, ground stop, ACFAA, holds the planes at origin. That means that the inbound airport is not overwhelmed. A bunch of airplanes in nowhere to park. So American Airlines and their travelers were very lucky that this did not last a long time. This is about an hour. Because we harken back to, you know, crowd strike, Microsoft, Delta Airlines. And that was the immediate thought that, so I was here this morning for a squawk when that news broke. And I remember everybody said in our newsroom, oh, it's going to be like another software update again. But it wasn't, right? And this was something that was easily fixed. And it wasn't minimally disruptive, right? Right. It was minimally disruptive. American Airlines is telling us that they don't even have any cancellations due to this issue. But this could very quickly have gotten much worse. When you get into three hours, four hours, and crews are timing out and they can't get to their planes, that's when you have an exponential effect on. You see a lot more cancellations. But they were lucky, Christmas miracle. And here we are. Yeah, but still decades old software. That seems like a gap there. Sometimes not throughout the entire airline. But there are some pieces that are old. Sounds like room for improvement. Yes. Another Leslie here today. And Leslie Josephs, thank you for bringing this to us. Next, Fund Stratt, head of research, Tom Leon, whether a year and rally is in the cards and where he sees Bitcoin heading in 2025. And then later on, former Sachs CEO Steve Sadov on why experiences are no longer the hot holiday gift and what it means for all the retailers out there. Over time is back in two minutes. Keep it right there. Get a head start on 2025 with CNBC's big January, the hottest tech event, CES from Las Vegas, the data, the jobs report, and meet the future of biotech and pharma at JPM Healthcare. Check out the MX Golf Tournament from California inauguration day and the meeting of world leaders in Davos plus the first Fed decision of the year. The investing edge you need to start the year ahead of the game, CNBC. All right, welcome back to over time. A few trends to watch in the markets. There's a head towards the end of the year into 2025. First of all, is the market cap theme, right? The large caps have been real outperformers so far this year. 27% for the S&P 500, 13% for the mid cap index and the Russell 2000's ball cap up about 11%. These two have been tracking relatively closely. This is the broadening out trade, but just in the last maybe a few weeks or so, you've seen that large cap escalation of performance. Again, will that continue in 2025? Another one is all of the so-called Trump trades, right? The ones that have kind of accelerated into the election and then in the wake of it, keep an eye on things like Bitcoin prices, the energy sector, which did have a nice rally and then it's kind of selling off a little bit now. And then Tesla shares, which have been up 83% since the election. So whether or not that has momentum into the new year remains to be seen. We'll keep an eye on that dynamic. And then interest rates, the last one here. Will the bond vigilante, so-called bond vigilantes, the people who put a verdict on the fiscal health of America continue to push bond prices for our sovereign debt lower and then yield higher in the wake of what anticipated will be the policies of the new Trump administration. Remember, at one point, the I shares 20-year long-term treasury ETF ticker TLT was over $100 when interest rates were at their lowest point this year. They've now dropped to about $87, $88 in that move here. And this is all on a full percentage point jump in interest rates for the 10-year note yield between what we saw earlier this fall to what we see today. So keep it on those dynamics, lastly, I'll send things over to you. It's remarkable as the Fed cuts rates to still see that pattern unfold given the state of the deficit and the bond vigilantes, as you mentioned. Now, the S&P tech sector closing at a record today in the Dow closed higher for the fourth straight day. It's longest winning streak in nearly a month. Joining us now is Fundstract Global Advisors, Head of Research, Tom Lee. He is also AC and BC contributor. Happy holidays to you, Tom. Thank you for being here. I want to ask you about the animal spirits because I was reading in the producer's notes that you believe they come back next year. What species of animals come back? And were they hibernating this year? Because we saw some species out in full force in 2024. So I'm curious which ones you think will be in full force in 2025. Thank you. The, what I'm thinking about with animal spirits and it's a Milton Friedman reference is the ISM's been below 50 for almost three years. Meaning companies have been cautious. Their visibility hasn't been great. But finally, the Fed is cutting. And we have an incoming administration that's seen as very business-friendly. And so I think companies for the first time in a long time are going to be expansionary, feel confident doing mergers. I think this is a very good environment for small cats, mid cats, the financials, and cyclicals broadly like in just real. So I think it's going to feel a lot like the market broadens in 2025, even as tech sort of keeps up with the market. Now, I know you are a quintessential optimist, Tom. But I'm curious, where do you see the biggest risks to that forecast for next year? Well, there's, you know, the big foil in 2025 is going to be whether or not there's a policy error and there can be two sources. One would be if the incoming administration does implement tariffs that are damaging to the economy because we know that they'd be immediate effects. Or if there are mass deportations that have some unknown impact on labor markets, the other source would be if the Fed becomes too inflation focused and allows the labor market to weaken. And so we actually slip from the Fed sort of trying to support the economy to the Fed trying to save it. I think that would be a very adverse development. Tom, one of the big themes that we just wanted to point out for viewers and listeners out there was this idea that cryptocurrencies will still be a focus given the focus of the incoming Trump administration. We know that you're bullish on many aspects of crypto. But I wonder if you might take us through where you see the best relative performance in that crypto landscape in 2025. Investors, you know, at our firm for the last eight and a half years, we have recommended us an allocation to crypto, including Bitcoin or Bitcoin in a helium. That allocation probably should be much higher in 2025 because the regulatory landscape is actually becoming more friendly. So I think Bitcoin still has to be at the core of someone's holdings. And I see Bitcoin getting to around 250,000 next year. But that would allow Ethereum, which is around 3500 down to probably do even better. You'll be Ethereum could get to 5,000 or 6,000 next year. And I think this is also probably the year where we call alt season where there's things like Solana and other altcoins do extremely well. Tom, if you feel as though, and this is a gun, relatively speaking, that Bitcoin is a commodity. And that some of the companies that leverage those commodities could be in play as well, much like gold and gold miners. What types of companies are going to be the ones that benefit the most from that crypto expansion if it were to hypothetically happen? 2024 has given us insights. If we look at the best performing equities that are related to Bitcoin, what we would call leveraged stories to Bitcoin, meaning that they're either acquiring Bitcoin as a treasury asset or they're leveraged to the price of dub very well. And that would be things like micro strategy, a similar scientific and coin base. And there are other companies that are sort of doing what Michael Sala would call the Bitcoin standard like Merra. But I'd say in investors portfolio, if they're especially a large cap focus, a company like micro strategy, gives you really good exposure Bitcoin. Time I'm increasingly seeing advisors pointing out alternatives is a potential risk on play for 2025. And this comes against the backdrop of a lot of alternatives managers looking to expand their distribution to retail to hide at worth. Do you think that is a good idea amid these animal spirits? And if so, what do you think is the appropriate allocation for something that is so illiquid in this current environment? Well, alternatives is a very large space, as you know, because that's referring to everything from real estate to private equity, to private credit to venture capital. I think each of those is in various states of sort of their own valuation cycle. It's been a very weak market for venture and private equity. So I actually think that those may be really benefiting from not only in easing Fed, but capital markets that is opening. Private credit has delivered some solid returns. But as you know, it's actually very well funded. And that is probably going to help put a floor on things like commercial real estate. So, you know, I don't focus on alternatives markets that closely, but I don't think it's a source of risk yet because there isn't the kind of leverage that would normally create a contractionary risk if there was a shock in that market. All right, Tom Lee at Fundstrat Global. Thank you very much for joining us on this Christmas and Hanukkah Eve. Happy holidays. So we'll see you soon. Merry Christmas. All right, there's no place like home for Apple, which is making another attempt to run into that smart home market. Find out what's different this time around. That's coming up straight ahead. And later, forward Tesla board member Steve Wesley on the potential risks and rewards facing the EV maker because of Elon Musk's alliance with President Electra. Get a head start on 2025 with CNBC's big January, the hottest tech event, CES from Las Vegas, the data, the jobs report, and meet the future of biotech and pharma at JPM Healthcare. Check out the MX Golf Tournament from California, inauguration day, and the meeting of world leaders in Davos. Plus, the first Fed decision of the year, the investing edge you need to start the year ahead of the game. CNBC. Welcome back Apple shares closing in a new high as its market cap closes in on $4 trillion. meantime, the company is reportedly doubling down on its smart home efforts in the new year. Steve Kovac joins us now with the details. More Apple. More smart homes and look, less like Apple is trying again here. This is nothing new. Apple has been failing to make a meaningful dent over the last six years or so since it really started dappling around in this space. Today, Apple supports smart appliances. Those of this stuff you go to Home Depot and buy through its home kit platform, but it's kind of a side show business right now. Nothing like the iPhone or the services businesses. HomePod you have right now for voice controlling these things and there's an iPhone and iPad app for controlling things on your personal devices. But reports now say Apple's gonna take another crack at this space just as the smart home market is due to grow again next year according to IDC that's a research firm. Back in September, they said they're expecting 930 million smart home appliances to go on sale next or to be sold next year. More than 4% growth over what they're expecting this year. And Apple likely gonna play a part of that according to Bloomberg report starting with a smart home hub which basically the way it's been described sounds like an iPad with fewer features and you stick it on your wall, lets you control all your smart appliances, maybe do some video conferencing, things like that. On top of that, Mingshin Quo, he's an analyst over at TF International Securities. He said Apple is also working on a smart security camera that would compete with those from Google and Amazon's Ring brand among many others. Bloomberg also reporting this weekend that Apple's working on a smart doorbell that would unlock your door automatically as your approach using the same facial recognition technology used today to unlock your iPhone. Those latter two gadgets sound a lot further off than the hub I was talking about earlier. Still, this is not expected to be a big business for Apple. The iPhone sales are the most important thing here and still showing lackluster growth over the last couple years. Services back to growth though and growing double digit percentage points over the last several quarters. That brings us to one option Apple does have here though. Low margin hardware, but they could leverage more iCloud subscriptions by selling these products for storing security video, things like that on top of those hardware sales guys. So it's gonna be interesting to see how they position this device if they do in fact announce it in March. Yeah, I like the application of not needing a key to get into your door, the facial technology. How does all the investment that they've made in AI play a role here? Because it seems like that could contribute potentially to some of the growth than some of the use cases here as well. You will not see Apple from this year on an out-to-product that does not have Apple intelligence. I can just tell you that right now, everything is going to be AI infused even if they wouldn't have once upon a time not called it AI, it's still gonna be AI. So what does that actually look like on a stripped down device like this? I don't know, but we do know Apple has its own large language models. We do know it has partnerships with chat, chvt. It's opening up those partnerships to folks like Google and so on. So it's gonna be interesting to see how that kind of integrates. But more interesting than any of this AI stuff, it's again, how do they position this? This is not a revolutionary ground-breaking product. There's not, it's kind of low-hanging fruit. Dom, you're telling me you've seen these Google hubs that they have for their smart home has a screen. It's kind of like a stripped down tablet, not a full computer. That's not something Apple usually makes. It usually makes something that does it all in one device. So it's gonna be really interesting to say, you need to buy this in addition to your iPad, in addition to your phone, in addition to everything else. Ecosystem effects, I think, are the- That's what they're going for. And also the standard that they have. So all these devices can talk to each other, even if Apple doesn't make it and keep it secure. All right, Steve Kovac with the latest on Apple here, Happy Holidays, sir. Merry Christmas. All right, time for a CMBC News Update with SEMA Modi. Good afternoon, SEMA. Good afternoon, Adam. Former President Bill Clinton is out of the hospital after being treated for the flu. He was admitted to the MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in DC yesterday. Clinton's team said he was touched by the kind messages and well wishes he received. The Starbucks Union strike is expanding to 300 stores across 45 states today. More than 5,000 baristas are expected to walk out on the job. The strike began last Friday. When talks between Starbucks and the Union stalled with unresolved issues over wages, staffing, and scheduling. According to the Union, this is set to be the largest ever strike to hit the coffee giant. And the speculation over Christopher Nolan's next movie has come to an end. The two-time Oscar winner is said to adapt Homer's Viotis the epic story that follows the journey home after the Trojan War. The All-Star cast will include Matt Damon and Hathaway Zendaya and Tom Holland, released eight set for July, 2026. So a bit of a later, Dominic. All right, it's a Nolan film, so it's gonna be epic. I'm sure. Anyway, thank you very much, Seymour, see you later on. Up next, former SAX CEO, Steve Sadav, on whether this is turning out to be a happy holiday season for retailers as consumers appear to be once again prioritizing gifts, things, over experiences, keep it right here. Welcome back during the season of giving. The bank industry is reminding you to practice safe checks. I can't take credit for that one. It's actually a real campaign by the American Bankers Association, Dom is sitting here shaking his head. And that is because Dom, series that you hear, checks are increasingly susceptible to fraud, even though their usage has actually plummeted in recent years. The number of suspicious activity reports filed by banks with the Treasury Department related specifically to check fraud has skyrocketed in recent years. The number of instances has more than doubled in the aftermath of the pandemic. And the Treasury says the mail is particularly vulnerable to check interception, or criminals will steal envelopes from mailboxes and then alter the checks inside deposit for their own benefit, or the thieves will use the checks they find to make more counterfeit checks. A recent government analysis of just a six month period in 2023 found that mail theft related check fraud was associated with nearly $700 million, which include both actual and attempted transaction. And of course, this can affect personal savings and business accounts, as well as the financial institutions that often bear the cost of check fraud losses, Dom. All right, I'm just laughing because I think you can only get away with practice safe checks on cable as opposed to broadcast, by the way. You get the point. Anyway, speaking of spending in checks, the holiday shopping season may be coming to a close today, but investors will be waiting to unwrap which retailers will be on the naughty or nice list. Joining us now to discuss this is Steve Sadov. He's the former CEO and chairman of SACS. He's also a senior advisor currently for MasterCard. He knows a thing or two about consumers and spending. Steve, thank you very much for being here on this Christmas and on the eve. So let's start off with this. Is the American consumer in a good position to keep propelling this economy? I think so. It's clear that this holiday season, they were out and shopping. The final numbers aren't in the till yet, but it looks like it was a very good season. The forecast had been for about a 3% increase in sales. I think we're going to be hovering at or above that kind of a number. The overall, the consumer was shopping in store and online, online performing better than in store. And overall attitudes, confidence, the consumer was shopping across categories, both experiences and stuff. And I think that as we go into 2025, they have jobs. The wages are increasing. Overall, confidence is really pretty healthy. There's a sense of optimism. There are obviously clouds on the horizon. But I think going into the year, we have a relatively robust consumer. There are ebbs and flows. And since the pandemic, we've seen this kind of flowing towards experiences and ebbing and things. But from what we're seeing across many different data points and surveys, is that the stuff trade is back again? People are going back to buy things, as opposed to just experiences. Is that stuff that you're seeing right now? Does your data, does your insight back into that kind of conclusion as well that buying stuff is back and vogue? Yeah, no question about it. I think what you had was a reversion to the mean. Think about it. Early in the pandemic, you couldn't go out. So there were no experiences. People were buying things for their home. They were stocking. They were buying groceries. And you had a certain categories where the winners. You had a lot of categories that were experienced related that were travel, getting out to sporting events, going out to eat. Those were losing. As you came out of the pandemic, you had a massive shift towards the experiences. And now what's happened is you're into a new cycle. You're getting renovations in electronics. You have a lot of innovation and other categories. So you're starting to see consumers back in to both goods as well as they're still going out. They want to go to restaurants where restaurants continue to do well. Food has done well over the period of time. A lot of it has been inflation related. You now have an easing off on the rate of inflation. But there's a demand both for goods and experiences as we sit right now. As that pendulum swings back, Steve, how would you characterize the price elasticity? Because at least my online shopping, it seems like everything is discounted. Now I don't know if it's discounted to the price that it actually should be. And it's just all psychological. But in terms of just the pricing power that retailers have right now, do you think they do have significant leverage in this environment? Well, I think we're an environment where value matters. If you look at who's winning and who's losing the value brands and retailers that are offering a value to the consumer have done extremely well. So while their consumer has a job, while they are getting their decent wage growth, overall, certainly at the lower end, the consumer is very stretched. And value is an operative word. That's why I see the off-price retailers doing extremely well. All of the chains that offer high value are doing very well. So I think that this question of price discounting is clearly there because the consumer needs it. And you're seeing it in the winners versus the losers. So I think though that the level of discounting is controlled. If I were to compare the level of discounting this year to last year, I would say it's relatively in line. Inventories were in line. So as I would look at it, the margin expectations as we come through the fourth quarter are going to be relatively controlled. And probably we'll be meeting the kind of expectations that analysts would have for margin. So I don't think discounting while it is there and clearly evident, I don't think it's out of line and higher than you've seen let's say a year ago. All right, Steve, say it of on the state of the consumer. Thank you very much. Happy holiday, sir. We'll see you soon. See you soon. All right, coming up next, former Tesla board member Steve Wesley on how present-elect Donald Trump's tariff and foreign policy plans could impact Elon Musk and the EV maker and makers next year. And later, what's at stake for Netflix tomorrow when it's huge Christmas bet on the NFL kicks off? Over time, we'll be right back. Welcome back, Tesla stock, the top performer on the S&P 500 today. And it's up more than 80% since the election just six weeks ago, but will that run last? Let's bring in Steve Wesley, founder and managing partner of the Wesley Group and a Tesla board member. Steve, thank you so much for being here. How much of this excitement do you think will actually turn into upside four Tesla? And where do you see the catalyst that really plan to this stock price movement in 2025? Well, look, 80% increase in share price just as the November election. That's no need for any territory. In the surge, it doesn't appear to be based on fundamental champion profits. So I think 2025 is really gonna be a big year for Tesla, make or break. Here's what investors ought to be looking for. I think you're gonna see auto sales last year, Tesla 1.8 million units. I think this year is gonna be about the same. That's flat growth. That doesn't really justify this big uptick. The real question is how quickly can Tesla get this subconpacked sub $30,000 model queue into the market? I think that's gonna be decisive. Steve, it's done. One of the big dynamics developing right now is not just in terms of Tesla's market position with other EV company competitors. It is also about the competitive advantage of the US versus China. The two biggest EV markets out there and producers right now. The policies that you anticipate coming out of the Trump administration, do you think it will be net beneficial, not just for Tesla, but for the US auto and EV industry when it comes to competing with the likes of China? Yeah, so I think investors ought to be worried about that. Here's the reality. The whole world is going to electric. China is the world's largest auto market. Almost twice the size of the US. They import virtually no cars to the US. So, slacking tariffs on them doesn't really have a big impact. But if we do that and Tesla, China responds in a con, that could be really a huge problem for US automakers. You need to sell cars into China. But the reality is the entire world is going electric. Seven of the 10 largest EV makers in the world are China-based. The US needs to up and get its game. I think the US would be wise to make it easier to sell cars in the US. This is probably not the smartest time to take away that $7,500 rebate. And it certainly helps, of course, to have Musk in President-elect Trump's ear. But I'm curious, if you're worried at all about a reputational issue, or if there's an Icarus situation where Musk has kind of garnered all this power, but then somehow there's a souring or falling out of their relationship if things could work in an adverse way for Tesla. That could certainly happen. I mean, look, you've got two very strong personalities here. They seem to be best-brows now. We'll see how long that continues. But I think the reality is, Mr. Trump said he did not like EVs up until literally a few months ago. Now he loves them. Could that change back? I think it absolutely could. But the reality is people are buying more EVs all the time. And the reason is battery costs are going down. The US needs to realize where the global auto market is going. We need to be at curfew, not just Tesla, but General Motors and Ford to follow along. We need to sell more EVs in the US as well as abroad. That's the way to win the auto wars. We'll see if that secular trend holds, regardless of their relationship in 2025 and beyond. Steve Wesley, thank you very much. You're bet. Thank you so much. Up next, former labor secretary Eugene Scalia, who's law firm is representing the Bank Policy Institute's new lawsuit against the Fed. He's going to discuss what's behind the challenge to the Central Bank's stress test coming up. As we reported earlier this hour, bank industry groups filing a lawsuit to get today against the Federal Reserve over the stress test process. Let's bring in Gene Scalia, partner at Gibson Dunn, and one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs in this lawsuit. He is also former labor secretary under President Trump. Gene, thank you very much for being here on this important day. First of all, I just want to ask you, what is it that you're hoping to accomplish with this lawsuit? Well, Leslie, first up, thank you. Good to be with you. And this lawsuit aims to improve the stress test that are used annually to determine the capital that banks need to hold to maintain their safety and soundness. My clients are not opposed to stress tests. They support stress tests. They conduct their own stress tests internally. What they are very concerned about is both the process by which stress tests are developed and applied by the Fed right now. And also the results, which are random, arbitrary, and ultimately bad for the US economy as a whole, because they're forcing banks, we think, to hold a lot more capital than is warranted. And so what we'd like to see is a new rulemaking process where the tests are vetted, where the public can see the stress tests, comment all the models that are used, and we can be more confident in the program that we have going forward. But the Fed came out just yesterday and said that they were open to making the process more transparent. So why final lawsuit? Why not go into negotiations with the Fed and kind of fix the process as you see fit from there? It seems like you're on the same page. I think it is good news that it's widely recognized that the current process does need to be improved. Ordinarily, when the federal government makes rules, it, of course, has to tell the public what the rules and standards are, so you know what you're being judged by. And also, in rule makings, you've got an obligation to let the public know what you propose, the public then comes back, gives feedback, suggests improvement, and those getting incorporated into the final rule. You may recall when the Fed and other bank regulators proposed new Basel capital rules a little more than a year ago, there's a lot of public comment which said, wow, you know, those models are unrealistic. They're too onerous. They can be improved. So it's good news that the Fed sees some of these problems at least with the process. My clients intend to work cooperatively with the Fed to bring those changes about at the same time, we were running up against a statute of limitations. My clients have been asking for years to see reforms in this system haven't happened. And so the limitations period runs in February of next year and they concluded that in order to preserve their legal rights, while they participated in this new process, the chair announced that it was time to go into court and bring this case. Jean, it's done. I wonder, I'd like to tap your unique insight here. You were a member of the cabinet for the Trump 1.0 administration. And I wonder because the bank stocks have seen a remarkable run this year largely due in part to the fact that there's a regulatory, at least relief trade happening. As you look and forecast for what the bank industry will look like in Trump 2.0, do you feel as though a more loose regulatory regime will be in play and will it ultimately help the banking industry? I think what we're hoping for is, first of all, my clients want bank safety and sound as they want stress tests. We all want that. That's best for our economy. But, don't you write. There has been too much regulation in the last four years. I think many feel that way. And the point is, it doesn't just impose costs on the banks, by the way, potentially tens of billions of dollars to a single bank in random variations in the stress test from year to year, but it's not just burdens on them. It's burdens on the entire economy. It's burdens on the people who depend on bank loans, who depend on bank intermediations. So the hope is that we'll have a more transparent process and more rational process. And with those things, a process that's less burdensome, not just on banks, but on our economy. One of the things we've also heard, Jean, about the idea of regulation is that it adversely impacts on a more relative basis, small and medium-sized lenders as opposed to the large money-centered banks like JP Morgan-Shay's Bank of America and City Group. If we do see a regulatory regime in the next four years, that moves more along the lines of what you're envisioning, what exactly can smaller and community-type banks expect to see with regard to their competitive position versus a JP Morgan-Shay's or a city? Well, one of the striking things about the current stress test regime is there's a widespread concern within across the industry. And again, my clients applaud the Fed for coming forward with its own recognition yesterday and its representation will be making changes. I think you're right, Dom, that over-regulation can at times have particularly onerous impacts on smaller entities. In this case, for example, small businesses are among those who suffer most from a banking system that's got less capital, that it's able to loan out, more than it has to hold. So I think that over-regulation sometimes does hit smaller entities hardest because they've got less of a buffer. But again, this is one that's hitting the entire banking sector in a way that's affecting American business broadly. All right, Gene Scalia, thank you very much for the time on this Christmas and Hanukkah Eve. Have a happy holiday, sir. Thank you, Mary Christmas. All right, coming up next on the show, what's at stake for Netflix as it gets ready to stream to NFL Games tomorrow and the potential fallout for the rest of the entire media business? And Netflix, a top performer in the S&P 500 today, Keebank Hiking, its price target on that stock to 1,000 from 785 citing optimism over its live events streaming. Welcome back to overtime. Netflix investors will have a huge gift under the Christmas tree tomorrow when the company livestreams not won, but two NFL games. Julia Borson has the details and Julia, full disclosure, I will watch both of them if my family lets me. You and millions of other people, Tom. Now, one reason Netflix shares are up more than 90% in the past year is the strategy we see in the streamer paying $150 million for two Christmas day NFL games. So investors are bullish on Netflix's ad supported tier and sports drive valuable real-time viewership for advertisers. Oppenheimer estimates, Netflix is generating $150 million in ad revenue for the two games. Plus, it has subscriber acquisition opportunities. And for the NFL, Netflix offers new global reach ahead of its expansion from five international games this year to a record eight next year and is considering as many as 16 international games. Here's what the NFL's chief business officer told us about Netflix's international appeal. The reach is global and you'll see global franchises like SquidGames and other programming that has really worked across the planet. That is giving us the opportunity for the first time to think of one partner and think globally at the same time. As for technical glitches and last month's Mike Tyson, Jake Paul Fight, sources tell us the NFL commissioner is confident in Netflix's capabilities for tomorrow and that he is in very close.
