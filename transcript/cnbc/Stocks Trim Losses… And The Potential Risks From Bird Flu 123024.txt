 It's CNBC's big January with CES from Las Vegas, biotech and pharma at JPM Healthcare, the World Economic Forum in Davos, and the first Fed decision of the year. Start the year ahead of the game, CNBC. Live from the Nasdaq Market site right here in the heart of New York City's Times Square, this is this is fast money. And here's what's on tap tonight, limping to the finish after a record breaking first 11 months of the year. Stocks sending the year where the whimper is a sluggish December a good or maybe a bad oldman for the new year we're gonna discuss in debate. Plus do we need to bear down with the bird flu? Why the CDC is concerned about mutations in the H5N1 virus and how a bad regular old flu season could impact the spread, bird flu. It's a real deal. And later on, inside micro strategies, no good, very bad, terrible, miserable month. And then down the head of the struggling housing ETF as well and chart mass looking at where the energy trade after a pretty good run the last few days, it's going from here. I'm Noppa, let's see, I'm Brian Selvin, good to see you coming to you live from Studio B right here at the Nasdaq and on your desk physically tonight. It's just guide army in myself, but we have Carter Worth, Mike Coe and Julie Beale, all standing by ready to go on this big hour show. And we're gonna start with a lot more red than green in your market today. All the major averages did close off their worst levels of the session. There's your good news. But just three stocks in the S&P 500, 30 rather, we're able to eke outgains today. Well today's winner is, look at that green guy. Sliver. I like that. I winkle a tiny. Yeah, winkle a little bit of green on your screen. Today's bigger winners today. SLB company, former known as Schlumberj, Royal Caribbean, the cruise line and Valera. They were finding an oil drilling company. Those gains totaled six cents. Energy today, your only sector higher. The weakness keeping most of the major averages in the red, i.e. down for the month of December, well, the NASDAQ is barely higher this month, a small cap, the Russell 2000, on pace for its worst month in more than two years. For the year though, remain firmly in the green with the S&P, up 20% for the second straight year. And that guy, Tommy, the first time that has happened since what is it? 1988. But does this 11th hour fade signal that all the momentum is gone? Or is this just an opportunity to buy in? Guy, I don't. I'm going to see. I'm going to effort to answer that in a second if you indulge me for a second. OK. You know, I think the world of you, you are as unique a talent that I have met over the years I've been doing this. And I am so excited that you and Kelli are going to be doing power lunch together. And I believe that starts this Thursday. So congratulations on that. You and Kelli are going to be dying of my together. You want to say that? I'm going to make me blush. Well, that happens to be true. Appreciate it. Because you bring an energy that, you know, a lot of people don't understand how talented you are. I happen to understand it having been sitting next to you for many years. So let's get into the market. I'll say this. You know, you sort of set it up with, is this a harbinger of what's going to happen early into 2026? And this is just my opinion. I think what the market is starting to realize is they wait a second. Interest rates matter, despite the fact that 10 year yields actually went lower today. And valuations clearly matter. You know, the couple stocks you mentioned in the energy space are names that you can actually make a compelling case around on valuation. I think the market has come to realization that there are a lot of sort of headwinds out there that have been and out there for quite some time. And now, for whatever reason, the market started to take issue with it. So the Vixit 17 and a half, I think that's going to be a story earlier in 2026. We've said that for a while. And I think you got a buckle in for higher interest rates, Brian. By the way, super kind. And I couldn't do with that grip. People like Guy and Dami and everybody else around me. So thank you very much for that. Carter Braxton Worth, let's go to the charts. You heard me at the top. It is back to back 20% gains for the first time since 1998. So 26 years hard to believe but true. But what are the charts? They take the strip, the emotion out of it. What are the charts? Say about this market. All right, so there's so many things going on at the surface and of course, under the surface. What we know is we have a very bifurcated market. The actual S&P is up 24% plus minus. But the equal weight is up half that 12. And we're seeing that in sector after sector, consider that the semiconductor index up some 20%. But the equal weight is down on the year. We know this is happening in the sector level as well. The telecommunications sector, basically a robust year, whereas the equal weight almost lunch. And so the question is, is there an analog? It's tempting to find analogs and compare this period to another period. But there's that expression analogies a weak form of argument. And that is true. It's a comfort blanket to find something similar. And say, we saw this before. This is what press on it is. There's not a lot of data. When you do statistics, you're talking about hundreds of thousands of inputs. There's 100 years of data. So it's 100 inputs. And this year versus that year, every time it's different. But what we do know is the market is full. Valuation is a terrible timing tool. So I don't want to say expensive or cheap. And no one knows what that really means. But the market is full. A lot of money has been put into the market. A lot of people believe in the general way being higher. And markets in January have a way of sometimes following through momentum or faltering. And I would suspect it's the latter that we faltered. You know, Julie, it's like CNBC hosts and guests have an impossible job recently because there's no denying. It's been an amazing two years. We can talk about 7 trillion and new debt added. Can we make our debt obligate? OK, fine. We'll get to that. But for an equity perspective, it's been a nice run until the last couple of weeks, maybe the last two months, for semiconductors. So how do we read it? Do we read it like, wow, we've really done well the last two years? Or yeah, that was then this is now in the set up to Carter's point. Doesn't look perfect. It doesn't, right? But I think this has been the last two years have been a really great example of the fallacy that you can really be able to predict with any accuracy. A lot of these outputs, they're just too complicated, right? Think of two years back. We were positive there was going to be a recession in 2023. And it didn't show up. I always get a little bit nervous when the consensus starts to really coalesce because typically, that means the market's going the other direction. It really likes to screw the most people it possibly can. And when we're really sure, that's when you need to be really nervous. But what I will say to Carter's point is I think there is an understanding that there are a lot of really challenging headwinds still in front of us right now, and that the valuations being full, a full valuation is not problematic all by itself. What it does create, though, is a high level of expectation. And when those expectations aren't met, there's a lot of crying as the stocks go down. And I hate, I shouldn't say hate. No, you just said it. I did. You know, when I double in down, I don't like, I hate the word, Mike, perfect, because it's too overused. It's the perfect casserole. It's used everywhere, right? Well, what? Any word? The perfect casserole. On cooking magazines. The word perfect is used for everything. You get my point, Mike, is that the market has been perfect. There's a lot of people I walk right out here and time square after the show is over, and people tell me they made the 20%. I brought it up earlier on the network today, because guess what? All you had to do was throw it dark, and the stock probably went up the last two years. That's kind of my point. I don't know if it's going to be like that anymore, but for people that literally just close their eyes and press the button and bought in video, they've doubled their money. It makes it seem like this is a pretty easy job, and it's not. Like, yeah. I mean, or they bought Bitcoin, or they bought Bitcoin, and they more than doubled their money. Yes. But God's smart, they have everyone's, everyone's a genius. Yeah, makes it really easy. I mean, I don't know that, you know, to Julie's point, if everybody's sort of coalescing around an idea, and that sentiment is bearish, then I kind of agree with the idea that, you know, you always want to sort of, if everyone's on one side of the boat, you probably want to start thinking about moving to the other side. But I'm not sure that everybody is on the bearer side. I mean, it sounds like a lot of people on the desk tonight are, but I think there's also a lot of opt of optimism. Certainly, we've seen and heard a lot of optimism from corporate management after the election. I mean, some have come out and said, you know, this is as bullish, at least on their own businesses, as they have been. The caveat I would offer is that we have seen sort of continuing claims on the employment side extend out a little bit. And if we start to see some weakness, you know, one of the things we don't talk about too much is sort of those incremental passive dollars that just flow into the market automatically. Every single time people are contributing to their 401K and so on. If we begin to see the employment picture worsen a little bit and then you also have everybody kind of in this tide of unbridled optimism up until about a week or so ago, then I think that we do have room for a little bit of downside in January. I, you know, it's tail end of December that happening. That's not the end of the world. We had a very bullish end to 21. Look how 22 started out. So that's not basically an indicator of anything. But I keep it on employment that I think is something we ought to worry about a little bit. I'll let you take the casserole thing back, Brian. But I'll say this. Since you mentioned, well, look at William Sonoma chart on the last year or so. I mean, that's been remarkable. So somebody is actually not only making casseroles but buying the what? You were so nice to me. The Dutch ovens in the middle. You get my point though. Everybody just made money in this market. And so my code just sort of touched on it. Passive investing. A trillion dollars of funds came. Their flows came into ETFs last year, which was a record. Passive investing trumps all else. And if you think about it, names like Apple, I think there are over 400 ETFs now, of which Apple is one of the top 1515 holdings. They win in this environment. The money flows in. Those stocks sort of, they reap the rewards of passive investing. And the levitation at the market's done is on the back of that. My concern has been and it's been unfounded. But it doesn't mean it won't happen. At some point, passive will start to become active. And it's never active on the way up. OK, let's bring in another voice in this conversation. I want to try to clarify what I was talking about. Ben Emman's chief investment officer at FedWatch, advisors must read daily notes. Here's the point I was trying to make casseroles aside then, which is this. Let's say somebody's gambling on football. And they bet five games, five bucks, right? They don't care. And they win all five. They get a little more bold. They start betting 10 bucks. They win five more in a row. Pretty soon, they might say, you know what? We're going to mortgage the house. I'm going to bet money I don't have because I can't go wrong. I can't miss betting on football. And I do worry there's a part of this market where that's where we are with stocks. And people have the risk has not gone out of the market, Ben. But I don't want people to get too confident, too cocky, too complacent, because that's when you get hurt. I think this is very bright because, you know, I described recently like it's like a casino market, or at least that some feel to it, right? You get speculated is coming in. And indeed, you know, with a blind eye, it just bad on something because it's going to go off either way. And so that casino elements, I think, is playing out a little bit here at the end of the year because those those are probably the people who want to take off the chips of the table really quick. So an absolute of this downward momentum. So with the panel that we're probably going into the new year, but some pressure on the markets, but keep an eye on what's happening with bonds, too, like we're having a pretty good rally today. I myself kind of buried on bonds, but I do think that too. There was not a blind eye on bonds, no casino there, really about fundamentals. I don't think you can a little bit of a rally in bonds too to start here. Do you okay, a rally in bonds? But let me ask you the other side. Do you think if we, it doesn't sound like you think we're going to be 5% 10 year, but if we got close to that, Ben, constrained your things have happened, can the equity markets, quote unquote, I'm doing air quotes survive? A 5% 10 year treasury? I think markets will be on the pressure because at 5% by and we may not even be, at 5% to high enough, because I think theirs where the psychology comes in on those who are, I think we the overweight bonds may start changing their minds, because I think that 5% represents what everybody has been pricing into the equity market and stronger economy with more inflation and effect than only I stay on hold. So may have to reassess where they are. So I think that's going to be a pressure point there. Not to mention, we do with this debt ceiling coming up in January, you can kind of tell during the budget resolution, and even today there's some tension about this speaking and about what's going on with that, that the bond market can react to that debt ceiling negatively, and the IE going higher with yields after this short and boom back to the foreseeing here on yield. So I think it's a pressure point, Brian. It's something that we have to watch, because we're going to go to 5% but I think we're going to go a little higher from there. Yeah, and Ben, your work has been extraordinary, and you've been one of the few people that thought that yields could go higher correctly. So, but what you're talking about in the very short term, I think it's tactical in the TLT rallying into January, yields may be going down to 4.4%. But do you think that could be on the back of potentially a flight to quality as the stock market sort of sells off? I think we've got a glimpse of that a little today. Yeah, I think that's right, guy. I think that's the relationship that probably plays out with people making note of economic data and surprising disease that those are curled down and yields have deviated from that. So there may be some reason here for people to say, hey, there's a short and tactical opportunity. But if you think about bonds and you think about the risk of bonds and you think about the economy, we have too much duration risk still in these bonds. Each time yields go lower, that duration risk actually goes up. What does that mean? So there's no duration risk in the Ben and Plain English for the folks at home on the radio that maybe new listeners and viewers because the stock market has done so well. Yeah, that's a good question, Brian. So think of the idea that if the yield of a bond goes up, the price goes down by X percent. That's kind of a duration measure. So duration five years, yield goes up by 1%, the price goes down by 5%. You know, and actually, currently today that duration and treasury is higher, it's more like six, seven years. So top six, seven percent loss that you can have on the treasury bond, it deals score by 1%. That's actually what happened this past fall. I think that risk has now debated at all. If anything, any kind of short and pull back in the yields makes that interest rate even more elevated, therefore future losses. So it's something to really keep in mind for people watching. Well, so I think it's an important lesson in education, Ben Evans, FedWatch advisors, have happy new year Ben, thank you very much. You know, Mike, I think he brings up a very interesting point, which is it was so easy and then bond yields reverse. September, they hit what, three, six, five in the 10 year. Now they spike back up and guess what happens? All these high beta, high valuation names, not all of them, but a lot of them get hurt. The market, Mike, can turn very quickly on people. Yeah, I mean, there's really two markets. I probably think of first when I think about the interest rate exposure, one is sort of the high duration equity. And when we're talking about high duration equity, we're talking about stocks, not ones that are paying big fat dividends and have sort of stable growth. But all of those companies that are pricing in a lot of future growth, those are going to tend to be more interest rate sensitive. And another area that's going to tend to be more interest rate sensitive is the Trump trade stocks, which is probably in Julie's wheelhouse, actually. But, you know, companies that are more capital dependent on the debt side, which is typically going to be the smaller cap stocks, Russell 2000 type names. Those are going to be very sensitive to interest rates in ways that sort of, you know, the high large cap stocks might not be. You know, I don't really see alphabet as being materially impacted by something like this. Those companies that carry a lot of cash on the balance sheet, actually, could see, you know, interest income, if you will, on the 50 billion bucks that they've got. And they don't really have much interest rate sensitivity elsewhere. But those are the two sort of barbell ends that you have to worry about if you're thinking about the 10 year rate liking. Yeah, a bit of pretty remarkable turn in, especially the longer end of the bond market. Guys, thank you. We're going to get back to stocks in just a second. But folks, obviously former president, Jimmy Carter, died yesterday. He was the age of 100. He had a two year fight, very brave fight with cancer. As a 39th president, Carter faced sky high inflation and oil embargo. The Iranian hostage crisis and a general sense of malaise in America. But Carter also oversaw the beginning of things like deregulation in things in industries like the airlines, railroads, and energy. And he appointed the man who would ultimately crush, crush inflation. That is Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Voker. It's not a political show guide, don't he? But I think Jimmy Carter's economic impact. 100%. I mean, you mentioned deregulation. I saw Mike this morning talking about similar. And a lot of people on Twitter were pointing at that. You can say what you want about his presidency. It was obviously a very difficult time in this country. With that said, I mean, the deregulation that we sort of enjoyed today is at the foot of that Carter administration some 40 something years ago. And I'll add this. You can make an argument that Paul Voker's the most important Fed chair that we've had over the last 50 or 60 years. And he was appointed by Jimmy Carter. He obviously did his work under the Reagan administration was put in place under Jimmy Carter. So a remarkable man. I don't think there's any denying that an incredibly well-lived life. And quite frankly, his presidency set up a lot of things that we're enjoying right now. Well said. And what's amazing is that Jimmy Carter, when he left office in 1980, was only 56, passed away at 100 years old, more fast money right after this.

Like the rest of the market, the semiconductor has got hit hard today. Now, most of that damage coming earlier in the session. But then the group, as the day went on, tried to recoup some of their losses. Now, overall, overall, Christina, the group still ended the day down, what we say is in the red. But of course, there's a company called Nvidia. Now, I don't know if you've ever heard of Nvidia, but they make chips for things that people are going to use. Nvidia stock actually posted... That was such a deep thought. I mean, incredible. With Brian Sullivan. Nvidia ended up 3-10s of 1%, although it was up 2% at its high. Christina, parts of Nautilus, joining us now with a, should we call it a deeper semi-sweep up? We call whatever you want. Yeah, you can call whatever you want. To your point, chips did fall in 10 with greater tech. Really, that's been the scenario for a little while, but there were specific narratives at play. And you mentioned the big dog in Nvidia, only one in the green after closing. Reason for that, there's two things. The acquisition of its startup Run AI, that went through developers. It helps developers optimize their AI infrastructure. And then another report actually coming from the information that says the parent of TikTok, bite-dance, plans to spend up to $7 billion on Nvidia's AI chips outside of China, and this is in 2025. So another customer. So Nvidia shares, though, if you look at it, it's just over a two-month basis. Pretty flat, maybe 1% down, barely above their 20-day moving average. And that's because of the rumors about chip delays, blackwall, and then chatter about the AI trade unwinding because large-language models may be hitting limits, and smaller models are getting really better. So you don't maybe need as many AI GPUs. But if you lump all of these players together, these AI winners, you know, Broadcom, ARM, Marvel, TSMC, may have been lower today. And then Nvidia, their average return on the air is still about 107% far up pacing the broader chip ETFs that are seen by the SMH. It's up over 40%, the SOX, up 14%. And then of course, you got those less AI exposure that are really feeling the pain. On semi-one of the worst-chip performers today, slowed down in EV sales, hurting them. And then the list goes on too, if there's slowed down in PCs and smartphones as well, impacting names like Micron, AMD, as well as Intel, because of that recovery that's taking a lot longer than expected. We are fortunate she is back covering this space, number one. Back from returning to leave, six months gone. And it's great, and she does an extraordinary job. And she mentioned these names. Nice to know, you're so nice today. As opposed to what? I don't know, you just very... And you say that. Speaking the truth. I'm speaking the truth. Where you are. Now you got me off my train of thought. What I was gonna say was though, we mentioned Nvidia, ARM, Marvell, absolutely. But for everyone of those stocks, I mean, look at what Qualcomm has done over the last five or six months since their earnings release. Look at what AMD has done. AMD was everybody's darling. That stock has been under considerable pressure. And then if you want to throw sort of a micron in the mix. So there's a lot of cross-currents in this space right now. And you know what's coming down the pike competition? And at 18 times sales, ish, which is where Nvidia is trading. It's not about price to earnings. That's reason of that. Price to sales. And their ability to grow into it, I think, is gonna be challenged. And Carter, Braxton, worth, here's the challenging part, I think, to guys' point. We love to lump these companies all together. We just say the semis, right? We say the banks. These are all different companies. To Christina's point, on semi-to-something very different than Marvell, which does something different than Broadcom. So when you look at the charts for the group and some of these individual names, what do you see? This is as bifurcated again, an area of the market as there is. So as a simple statement, if one had to check a box, semis were good or semis were bad in 2024. The answer is, of course, they were bad. The Philadelphia semiconductor index itself is up 20%. That's less than the market. And it's a whole lot less than the tech sector, up 37. 16 of the stocks in the index are up 14 or down. For the year, it's been a treacherous area. It required perfect stock picking and not aggregation, not just being long a theme. And what's so ironic is it was such a good theme for most of the market, which is to say, if the tech sector is the most important part of the market at 32%, and semis are the leading edge of that most important sector, and we're the most owned and most believed in, with, of course, Invidian Vago becoming such drawings, how is it possible that after all of this, the equal weight semiconductor index is down on the year 1.2%. Bad year for semis. He said a lot. He typically, what is it? What is he, he's surprised. No, but I mean, he was like the most important group and the most important group and they're down. We're gonna get more on that later. Christina, great to have you back. She has M&M's on her fingers. You see what she's got going on? Christina, parts of the levels, thank you very much. She'll poke those in the long end. More fast money and we're back. Set the clauses. Right. After this, here's what's coming up next. See NBC exclusive. Avenue Capitol CEO Mark Lasri.

Avenue Capitol CEO Mark Lasri. His 2025 market outlook. Where is he putting his money now? And investing in sports. Stay ahead of the market. Squawk box tomorrow. 6 a.m. Eastern. CNBC. All right, welcome back to Fast Money. The year's hottest Bitcoin stock. Down, 8%. In fact, not only that, it closed near session lows. We're talking about micro strategy. Now, micro strategy. Through its polarizing CEO, Michael Seller, said. It bought $29 million worth of Bitcoin in the week ending Sunday. At an average price of just under $98,000. Now, that is a sharp decrease from the prior week. And down more than $2 billion from the start of the month. That's total Bitcoin value. Shares of micro strategy. Now down nearly 22% over the past month. So do we play any weakness here? Let's talk about micro strategy. Okay, so, Michael, first off, talk to us about what we do about the stock. MSTR. And secondly, what are your thoughts on micro strategy? Because I get the feeling that micro strategy has more than the ability to move the price of Bitcoin. What say you? So, you know, I am a Bitcoin believer. And I continue to be. We know. But this is probably not the place that I would do it. And that is, there's a couple of reasons for that. One is that it's not like Bitcoin itself isn't a particularly volatile asset. It is quite volatile. Probably about 55, 60% annualized standard deviation. Micro strategy is a very levered way to play that. Now, of course, micro strategy has a strategy, which is a creative to shareholders by issuing debt, issuing equity, essentially being able to purchase the underlying Bitcoin at effectively a difference in creating some additional book value per share for micro strategy shareholders. That's the good news. The bad news is that, of course, this introduces a great deal of leverage. I'm not sure that they're wholly unique in their ability to do this. So, I do worry that there could be others that would say, you know what? I'm looking to take advantage of capital market, capital access to, you know, do leverage plays on Bitcoin as well. I would probably stick with IBIT instead. All right. Julie, be able what you take on Bitcoin? Micro strategy, both? Well, I mean, I think if I were a shareholder of micro strategy and I were getting diluted so that the company would be able to be buying more Bitcoin rather than, I don't know, running its own business. It's akin to your neighbor's kid who lives in his basement asking you for money to buy more Bitcoin. Like, just buy the Bitcoin yourself. You don't need to lend them the money. It doesn't make any sense to me in this kind of positioning. And I think it's akin to what we're seeing in GameStop. It's really run up on, you know, the hopes and dreams of a lot of guys, frankly. Well, there are people that are allowing Michael to do what he's doing. Michael says, Michael says, not doing anything wrong. I mean, people come at him and say, hey, you know, we have these great opportunities for you. We can do these convertible bonds. And as long as the market allows him to continue to convert his stock into Bitcoin, he will do that. He has said as much. And he's a person that has said countless times that he will buy the highs in Bitcoin on a consecutive basis year after year because by definition, they will continue to buy it. The problem will arise, though, with an average price now, I think of $62,000 or such on their balance sheet. You know, if Bitcoin were to go back down to that prior resistance level of 70,000 or so as they continue to buy, that average price is going to equal potentially where Bitcoin is trading. And that could trigger some really interesting things. So I think we all agree that micro-saturday the stock is just a levered ETF for Bitcoin. But you're getting into some dicey areas of Bitcoin with a continuous sort of go lower from here. Well said, I missed the days of micro-srategy. It was just to Julie's point, a plain old simple software. Well, he doesn't miss those days. No, he doesn't. Because it's work. What he's done has worked. And it works until maybe it'll work forever. All right, coming up. We're going to switch gears. We're going to talk about, bird, consume. Yeah, confirm cases hitting double digits in America. Former FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb is here to separate. Fact from fiction. Talk about the risk of a real outbreak. And what it might mean for you and your money. We're back. Right up. All right, welcome back to Fast Money. The US Treasury Department. Saving, saying, Chinese hackers. Get this. Yeah, Chinese hackers. Stole documents. Is what it being called a major incident earlier this month. Emily Wilkins, NDC. And Emily, when I hear Chinese hackers evading treasury, stealing documents. The term major incident kind of comes up. It does, Brian. No, I think this is something where there's a reason that we're talking about this now. That a state-sponsored actor in China did hack into the US Treasury Department. And this is, of course, according to a letter that has been obtained by CNBC. Here's what we know so far. We know that the hacker was able to access a third-party software provider called Beyond Trust. And from there, they were able to access unclassified documents that some treasury officials had in their workstations, according to the letter. The Treasury Department was made aware of the hack on December 8th. Now, the Treasury Department spokesperson said in a statement that Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems and the data it holds. Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense. And we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors. Now, the compromise software has been taken offline. And at this point, there is no evidence that the hacker can still access treasury information. Brian, I think it's a question at this point. Could something like this happen again? What is being done for events, something like this, from happening again? If any information did those hackers get that could be used in the future? And I think to a certain extent, a lot of those are future questions that we're only going to learn the answers to in time. It feels like a big story. Emily Wilkins, we appreciate it. Thank you very much. In more good news, BirdFlu impacting everything from egg prices to cattle supply. 66 cases now confirmed in humans so far this year. And there's actually a new worrisome development. Genetic samples from a patient hospitalized in Louisiana showed that mutations could make BirdFlu, which is called H5N1, spread more easily among humans. While your next guest says the likelihood of BirdFlu becoming a pandemic is very low. I want to make that very clear. He does believe the US has done everything wrong when it comes to containing the virus. Dr. Scott Godley joining us on the fast line. He's a former commissioner of the FDA and a CMBC contributor. Dr. Godley, I'd like to say it's good to have you on, but I wish you didn't because it means this is going on. What do you mean we've done everything wrong? Well, this is still viewed by most experts as a low probability risk as you noted, but there's a range of opinions on this. And most agree that it could be a potentially high impact event. Should we should this break out and we should be taking more steps to mitigate it. A lot of the things that we've done, we've done late. The USDA only recently implemented a program to start testing bulk milk shipments to try to detect outbreaks on dairy farms, where a lot of this infection is localized. It's only in the past summer that we started compensating farmers for the losses they sustained by turning over cases on their farms and the compensation is still too low. We haven't distributed tests to dairy farms. They can start testing their workers. There was one recent study done. I'll be at a small study that showed upwards of 7% of all dairy farm workers have likely been infected already with the BirdFlu. And we haven't done anything to compensate dairy farms for losses they sustained by turning over those cases among their workers, lost days of work, absences, things like that. And I think we need to do more to be compensating these dairy farms if we want them to do the right thing. They're on the front lines of this risk right now for the American public and we can't expect them to bear the full burden of that. We also haven't taken steps to stop pile the full range of antiviral drugs that could be effective against this virus. We have a lot of Tammy flu in the National Stock Pile upwards of 60 million doses, but a lot of that's old. And it could be the case that if this virus does break out it may be susceptible to one antiviral drug but not another. So you want to have the full range of antiviral drugs available. And we've started late updating the vaccines that could be effective against this virus. The vaccines we have stockpiled right now about 10 million doses may not be effective against this particular strain. So we need to update those vaccines and have them prepared as a potential hedge against this breaking out. 71% of the herd dairy herds in California have been exposed to H5N1 and I bring up California because we don't realize that it actually is the biggest dairy production state. California is a monster when it comes to agricultural products. Do we need to worry about the nation's milk supply or is that just taking it maybe to the integral a little bit too far? Well look, this is probably wider than just California. California is doing a lot to test their dairy farms so they're turning over the cases. This may be more widespread among other states as well. There are real economic risks to the spread of this virus. When cattle are infected they often are put to slaughter. This could become an issue with the milk and the meat supply in this country if it continues. As you said, 75 herds across 16 states have already been infected. And it kills upwards of 2 to 5% of the infected cows and milk production goes down about 20%. So as this becomes more widespread and it's likely to continue to spread among dairy cows at this point seems to be endemic in the dairy herd in this country, you could see an impact on milk and dairy supplies. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, I guess happy to hear. Dr. Gottlieb, thank you very much. Thank you. Can you tell us more about the virus? Well, hopefully not. But if you remember pre-COVID, I mean this was something that was on people's radar screen that people were very concerned about. And my concern would be, again, politics now was standing. I think people are sort of COVID fatigue and they're going to dismiss this as another whatever it is they call it. Government hoax and those types of things. And the fear is that people don't take it as seriously as I think they probably should. That's it. So, I think the number of people who are in the dairy market is 26 confirmed human cases. All right, coming up. A flop in the flipping market. Why profits in housing are down and whether the trend will continue in the new years, that all look up with the housing story, you don't hear very much anywhere else. We're back, right after this. All right, welcome back to Fast Money. There's been a lot of tough news today. This is not one of those times. There's good news. Pending home sales up for a fourth straight month, the National Association of Real Tours, porting a 2.2% month over month gain in November, total pending home sales at a two month high. But if buyers hope to, you know, buy and then flip their homes quickly, beware. There are some cracks forming in the flipping business. Diane Ollock has the flipping details. Diane.

You didn't tell me about that. I should probably prepare in the commercial. We're going to talk about energy and oil and gas coming up right after the break. Assuming I'm still here. We're back right after this. the money. Not everything was down today, Guy Don Yesell. Oil was hired today. Oil is now up about 4% for the month, but really an energy oil is not the story. Natural gas blowing up, hitting its highest level in nearly two years. But what do the charts on all of energy say? Well, we don't know, but the chart master Carter worth does. So Carter, what do some of the energy charts show? Well, let's get right to it. Let's look at crude oil first. We have two charts. This is going back to the early 1980s. And of course, we have the all time high essentially 150 that was in 2008. We got close to that after the Ukraine invasion about 135. And here we are sitting here. So I would say in the middle of the tennis court, which is to say, it's a paratuse. It's a non trade. The here and now chart, if you want to zero in a little bit tighter, you can see the chart. The question is, as annotated there, is that something of a bottom. The green arrow, that's my judgment. Others might put a red arrow. I think as you can trade this higher for about three to four dollars a barrel. But in terms of the shares market, let's look at the sector. What I wanted to try to depict here is we have these are a 10 year weekly charts. We're the same level we were essentially 10 years ago. The peak was in 2014. We got close to that year. And we're going to see the same chart right here. Now just go through the next couple charts fairly quickly. This is the same chart. And what we know is the earnings are identical for the sector earnings per share for the sector as they were in 2014. Also look at sales. You'll see it's the exact same thing. You can do this also for EBITDA. We are essentially at the exact same level as well in terms of profitability. So the question is is this a defensive area of the market even as the high flyers micro strategies give way. My hunch is to be overweight energy in 2025. Makes sense. I mean, if you think we talked we started the show about valuations and I think as people realize how expensive some of the sectors of the market are and they look for places where they can find value, they're going to find it in the form of these energy stocks and people will just sort of do the overlay of the WTI chart and you will see that you're brilliant in this space. I mean, it's not that simple. WTI could trade sideways in perpetuity and these still would be very profitable, well-run companies that are not being rewarded in the form of valuations. So I'm with Carter on this one. Okay. Thank you for the another compliment. Mike, could you think that these companies are worth anybody's money because they haven't done a whole lot, I don't know, in the last couple of years really. No, they really haven't. But I think that's really the point that everybody's making. I don't think anyone's really looking for crude, go back to a hundred bucks a barrel. The world is very well supplied at this point and we probably are going to see a little bit more supply coming from OPEC and OPEC plus as some of their sort of production curtailments run off into the middle of 2025. But the thing is that a lot of the companies that we're talking about are trading it relatively cheap multiples, have decent yields and are profitable at the moment. We're going to see a little bit more trading in the middle of the 20th century, and this is going to be a little bit more in the middle of the 20th century. So you'll be able to see a little bit of the vegetable trading in the middle of the 20th century, which is going to be a little bit more profitable in these areas. So if you're worried about all over the multiple expansion you've seen in other areas you might start looking at stocks that haven't seen any. And it's That's money, final trades, Julie Beale, kick it off. I think housing inventory is going to continue to be constrained. And so Dreamfinder's homes and entry-level buyers would benefit here. I like my coat. Alphabet deserves a market multiple. More than the market does at 25 times, that would be 20% upside from here I like Alphabet. He likes it. Hey, Mikey. Do you know what's the last name of those brothers? Save it after Carter. Small cap, biotech, unicure, simple QURE, huge move, more to come. So the light...
