 weekdays at 5 a.m. be first on world markets first to the global business conversation get a jump on the investing day every day with Frank Holland success starts early worldwide exchange 5 a.m. Eastern CNBC you're listening to the exchange here's today's show. Thank you very much Courtney and welcome to the exchange. I'm Kelly Evans. Here's what's ahead the vote to elect a new house speaker is currently underway with the second slimis margin in history for the party in control if it fails that will have big consequences for capital Hill for business and for the economy will bring you the very latest tally's as we get them and game out these potential impacts. Plus despite the DC drama our market guest is bullish on the US he's here with where he's seeing the biggest opportunities in the new year but are the charts telling a different story our technician brings the three of them that are making him worry this is one of them it's our mystery chart today he joins us ahead with what he's watching and how he's trading it before all that though let's get to Don Choe with finally Don maybe a break in this losing street yeah I mean it's a five day streak for the S&P a five day losing streak for the NASDAQ Kelly to that point of four day for the Dow we look poised to snap but we've still got a few hours to go but still let's start with the broader S&P 500 which is currently at 59 29 it's up 60 points or one full percent that's right near the session highs which are currently at 64 points to the upside even at the lows we were only up 20 still an update overall the level a lot of traders are watching right now for at least the short term is 59 44 in the S&P that represents that 50 day moving average or medium term trendline for the markets the Dow industrial is up to 145 points 42 thousand 636 the NASDAQ can pause a tech heavier trade for super discretionary and for technology up to 19 thousand five forty that's good for 260 points or one and one third percent gain there one key industry group in focus moving to the opposite direction our beverage alcohol companies and this is all tied to headlines coming out of the Biden administration specifically the surgeon general who's calling for warning labels that are linking cancer risks to alcohol consumption that is not the only driver of downside but it's a big one from a headline perspective Diagio down to about three and a half percent brown for men down about one and a half percent same for constellation and hyzer bush in bed most encores you kind of get the idea so again it's not the only driver but it's a sentiment shift here for the beverage alcohol companies for for sure take a keep you an eye on that and then one of the place to keep a night on is another headline out of the Biden administration and that's the formal news today of the blockage of the deal for Japan's Nippon steel to buy us steel those shares are down about 6 percent right now that's just about what they've been pretty much all session long but now with the administration formally coming to block this deal the question becomes what's next for us deal are there other potential suitors are there lawsuits that happen we'll find all of that out in the coming weeks KEL all send things back over to you indeed dumb for now thanks very much dumb to the house is voting to elect a speaker for the new congress and the path from Mike Johnson to remain in the role is really narrow Emily Wilkins is on Capitol Hill with the very latest kick things off the sour Emily what should we expect hey Kelly well as you can see members are now in the middle of voting I think they're right in the seas so they still have a long way to go they're calling member by member by member and we had congressman Tim Birchit tweet just a little bit ago that he expects us to go on for multiple rounds so he's expecting Johnson to lose the first round Birchit though he just voted for Mike Johnson and we've seen a number of other holdouts go ahead and support him could be because just before this started Mike Johnson seem to respond to some of the concerns from some of the fiscal hawks in the conference he tweeted that he would be creating a working group comprised of independent experts to work with doge and reduce government spending Johnson also said that that working group will review existing audits of federal agencies and Johnson pledged to have committees take aggressive reviews of agencies now Johnson was optimistic heading into this vote saying that he thinks he has enough support to win but when asked how many rounds he'd be willing to go Johnson said he is ready to go the distance Johnson said that we have to get this job done and unified the conference and I'm here for the long run now it seems like Johnson has swayed at least a few Republicans Victoria Sparks who we thought could be a no is now a yes and just a reminder if all members are here only two Republicans vote for someone other than Johnson he won't be able to win the speakership and we can go into a second ballot or a third or take a break and have more negotiations at this point we're also seeing a couple members who were holdouts not vote their name gets called we saw this for Andy Biggs we've seen this for Michael McLeod and they don't say anything and they will have a chance then at the very end of this role called ballot the court will go ahead and call the names of those who haven't voted so we might exon exactly know which way this goes until the very end depending on what some of these folks who are holdouts and are not answering how they ultimately decide to go tell us messy of course insisting that he'll be a no reiterating that last night and we'll see what happens Emily for now thanks Emily Wilkins will be monitoring the vote for us my next guest says if there is no speaker president elect Trump's agenda and the economy are in jeopardy the ripple effects he said could boggle the mind for more let's bring in Larry Lindsay he's president and CEO of the Lindsay group and was director of the National Economic Council under president George W. Bush also former Fed governor and Larry it's great to see you again and and to also help explain the significance of a vote that is going to be very very slim so for you it's only if he loses and if they can't figure this out there could be immediate consequences what are those sure well the first thing is if there is no speaker there is no house of representatives speaker swears in the house no speaker no swearing yet now on Monday the house and the Senate are supposed to vote to certify the electoral college vote and if there is no house the house can't certify the electoral college vote so president Trump will not be president we will not have a president until well on what will happen on January 20th is Chuck Grassley who is president pro-Tem of the Senate he's the longest serving Republican Senator majority senator he's 92 will become president of the United States but it's hard to see how the Trump agenda passes how we get a budget deal how we get a tax bill action of any sort no this is this is a big vote I'm surprised the markets have ignored it frankly this is a huge huge event if they don't elect a speaker by what date you think Chuck Grassley becomes president of fact basically but on the 20th he becomes president of the 20th right so if they elect a speaker before the 20th and the house certifies the electoral college vote the Trump will be president you know I doubt will go that long but it is possible that on Monday possible that on Monday which is when the electoral college is supposed to be certified it is not so if you were talking to Thomas Massey to those who might have you know philosophical holdouts with with with Mike Johnson say he's making deals with the Democrats and so forth I mean what do you tell him well does he want is he for the Trump agenda or not it's very simple he's voting right now he's voting against the acting the Trump agenda if he doesn't vote for the speaker yeah again there's going to be some back and forth and people can you know vote and then change their mind and see if pressure is exerted I don't know I maybe Larry the market is telling us they think Johnson's going to win it's going to turn out to be a non-event ho-han everything's fine well I hope they're right I think there's a good chance they will be right maybe not on the first ballot but there's a good chance that Mike Johnson will be reelected as speaker and then everything can proceed but I'll tell you we shouldn't be sweating this is a ridiculous situation to be in and is it ridiculous because of the margin or for other reasons I think it's not unusual for Washington it's ridiculous because the ego is involved I think when mr. Musk pulled the rug out from under the speaker it didn't help they left him swinging the wind for a week they didn't realize they had a problem and then the president finally woke up to the fact that he has a problem has been lobby and hard ever since but we'll see whether that works or not what do you make of the Trump Musk partnership and the way in which musk and Ramaswami's goals may antagonize and divide and fracture the GOP when it has this very slim majority to begin with the the thing is that it's striking about both Jeff there both very smart I can enormous respect for both men right yeah musk in particular is a visionary but but visionaries often don't understand how Washington works a Washington is not a visionary place it's an implementing place and when you try and mix the two it doesn't happen and I think that he has a lot of learning to do you know I sympathetic to the criticism of Washington but you still got to play by Washington's rules I don't care what you say with that in mind Larry and if you said okay well their goal or you know maybe you could argue part of the mandate Trump was elected with was you know cut government spending kind of get after the deficit and so on and so forth what's the best way to do that in the world of kind of real Washington politic Johnson well we you know we no one's invented what yeah I guess they did in the 90s well a little bit and and and Reagan did I was there actually for Reagan's efforts and there was some pruning back it's very hard it's called the swamp for recent and all the animals in the swamp for me ecosystem and cooperate with one so we'll have to see it's you know the ideal situation for a member is to give speeches back home about how he wants to bear the deficit cut waste but then again have the waste that goes to his district still comes through and that's that's the unique problem and they're all the same one and so Larry when you look at the president's agenda and what you think is likely to actually happen you we have this big like the dagger out there of the expiring tax cuts you know the border energy so many of these different initiatives they say maybe that's just going to be one big bill I don't know I mean what are your expectations for the next three six twelve months well assuming Mr. Johnson is elected speaker the House will be able to function they're going to have to start moving fast they lose two Republican members who are going into the administration on January 20th and they won't have special elections for those districts until April 1 so there's kind of a two-month hiatus there where it's going to be hard for the Republicans to command a majority and so nothing will move they can still work in committee and things like that but it's going to be it things are going to be more delayed than what you expect that's why the rules committee from the last progress set up a set of rules that can fast track a bunch of legislation and that may lead to votes before January 20th so the president can claim that he got a lot of his agenda through early on but the the really big bills dealing with how we're going to deal with the deficit how we're going to deal with avoiding a huge tax increase in January 20th that's what it is I mean everyone talks tax cuts no no we've had the same tax rules for eight years if you end those tax rules it's an increase in taxes in January 26th big enough frankly to close a recession in 2026 so there's a lot at stake here in getting things fast and then I guess my final question although I wanted to quickly ask you about the Nipon steel block as well but the final question on this is do you feel bullish or bearish that about the U.S. economy this year because you've been pretty optimistic you've been saying inflation's going to remain higher than expected but is there a shift in tone now well there will be if Johnson loses right I think that could really throw monkey rich in the works but no the U.S. economy is strong I think the big surprise this year is going to be real wages this is the natural part of business cycle to for labor to get yet share back remember real wages actually fell four years of a president buy so it's time for them to claw it back and the higher real wages are going to raise costs for business on a priority the market participant I would be a little bit oh it looks like they just approved it that's why people are applauding we'll see I'm holding my breath until they tell me anything officially bullets dodge they wouldn't have the applause going on if they had elected somebody I think the members of the house are all really the better what let me quickly then Larry sneak this in before we have to come back to the vote outcome I mean what do you think about blocking nip on an ally a Japanese company arguably better technology maybe you say from taking over U.S. deal you side with with Biden and maybe with Trump on this one that it should be blocked and would you let it go through well either we believe in a free trade a generally free trade agenda with our allies in Japan is whenever oldest allies at least since they were enemy since 1945 and old as allies and not only that it's good for U.S. deal this capital injection the jobs are more secure frankly this is just playing politics by the president president Biden in this case and Trump would have done the same thing I think they're just playing politics it's a bad bad side all right I think you know I think they're just roll call I think they roll called Johnson which is why he got the applause and they're only on the case of the alphabet so this could go into next hour yeah exactly Larry thanks for joining us really good to check in with you on a number of fronts and and what's going to be very interesting year right it sure will be Larry Lizzy with the Lizzy group you too thank you so much despite all the noise and DC drama my next guest sees several areas of opportunity in the U.S. in stocks and in bonds let's bring in Darrell Krunk he's the CIO for wealth and investment at Wells Fargo Investment Institute Darrell welcome to you maybe I'll start with bonds it's been a terrible stretch for them the last several years it has Kelly you're right I think if you look at the Bloomberg aggregate we're up 1.4% for 2024 for just straight U.S. treasuries that and that's when we were up five and a half percent going into basically the fourth quarter of the year so we gave a lot of that back December was a really ugly month I think the the third worst on record in the last 45 years for treasury futures so we reprice the yield curve considerably but you would be a buyer here we're starting to extend duration here we've been crowded to the short side of the curve we're starting to the leg out we don't think you have to run and do that all at once I think the key in 2025 here is you need both the 10 year treasury and the unemployment rate to both state below 5% if that can happen you're going to get some good economic growth we've put three quarters in a row now in the books with 3% US GDP growth that's far better than the rest of the world and remember earnings are priced in nominal terms right so if I'm getting called 2.5 to 3% inflation and I'm getting 2.5 to 3% GDP growth I'm at you know 5 5 and a half percent nominal that's a really healthy environment for earnings and I think for stock prices in the next year and that's kind of where you're going I like how you said that we want both unemployment and bond yields to stable 0 5% that's right stocks by the way then do what I mean coming off a couple of strong years yeah I mean obviously it's well documented two years in a row plus 20% hasn't happened since 1998 only the fifth time in history has happened we said 57 new record highs for the S&P last year so the bar is high coming into this year but remember almost all of 2023 was done through multiple expansion and virtually no earnings growth what it looks like well when we do when we ink the fourth quarter earnings here as we step off in earnings season we'll have somewhere around 9% earnings growth for calendar year 2024 which is healthy and then next year we're at 2.75 on the S&P that compares to where we'll finish the year for EPS it probably 2.43 244 so that's a healthy 12 13% growth we don't think multiples can expand from here because multiples are already high on a historical and relative basis but if you get 12 13% earnings growth prices can go up in line with earnings growth even if multiples stay the same sure I think a lot of people would take it well you know you're hearing to this this kind of argument it's it's contrary and to kind of go international with a lot of people saying how can it get any better for the U.S. we continue to climb in terms of market cap we know the challenges rest of world but once everyone's on one side of the boat maybe we should think about why you see how hard it is to me even ask the question is it possible that international stocks can outperform because I don't see it but it tells you that maybe it maybe it'll happen you're right and it's a right question to ask look I mean it's been asked every year for the last five years running and every year it's been a value trap right to try to go internationally minus a few select markets I mean with you with Germany basically inter recession France on the cusp of it China having their problems with stimulus the strong dollar I mean people are underestimating when you look at what the dollar has done just in the last 90 days it's in the 93rd 94th percentile of moves historically for a strong U.S. dollar that is just really hard on international markets and on international earnings can that abate and the dollar can kind of level off here and even even come down a little bit in the next year that would be helpful for international companies but right now between rates going higher and the dollar going higher it's really putting pressure on emerging market and develop market equities it's ironic because it sometimes puts puts pressure on us as well so it seems nobody benefits from that strength that's right you have I can't really necessarily give a specific names but in terms of kind of themes you're sticking with where the innovation is coming from where the new growth is coming from gen AI industrial power can you get any more specific on that especially for some of these trades that already feel quite crowded yeah I mean look two years in a row the three best performing sectors have been tech communication services and discretionary right so obviously they're not cheap we do think that trend continues although our most favorable right now in our portfolio is energy we think energy is cheap you're getting a solid dividend oil prices are back on the move higher we're about you know pushing up to the to the 50-day moving average could break through that we also like industrials and we also like financials so I think I think the story for equities in 2025 is the both delivery of that earnings growth but also a widening of breadth which as you know has been extremely narrow the last two years you've got the top six stocks making up 31% of the S&P top 10 making up 40% you've got to get financials and dust reels some of these other areas that haven't participated as strongly last couple years to really help take the lead in 2025 all right Darrell Crock thank you appreciate it giving us the playbook for 2025 and coming up the S&P 500 buyback index tracks the hundred stocks with the highest buyback ratios names like Apple the group is actually underperforming the broader index since the start of last year but one strategy just says it'll be companies buying back stock not investors that drives the market in 25 he'll join us to make his case but first tensions with China or on the rise after Beijing targeted targeted more than two dozen companies with trade controls we'll get a live report from Beijing and look at the impact to investors with the crane share CIO that's next on the exchange this is the exchange on CNBC global markets up to the minute front page news wake up to Frank Holland and worldwide exchange weekdays five a.m. Eastern CNBC live ambitiously China is hitting more than two dozen U.S. companies with new trade controls and adding 10 to an unreliable entities list that will prevent them from doing any business in China unissuunous live in Beijing with those details Boeing is among them right uniss yes yeah that's right lucky martin rathion a lot of these units that the these larger corporations have are now among the targets of the Chinese so China is is banning trade of dual use items for 28 American defense contractors and then ten of these companies are on a blacklist for their sales of arms to Taiwan which is an island that Beijing claims as its own in addition to that the Chinese are taking aim at the EV industry the commerce ministry said that it's revising its export control guidelines to include technologies that are important for the production of EV batteries so this includes lithium and gallium extraction and refining and battery chemicals and processing which influence the battery performance so it's unclear a Kelly just when these new revisions are going to come into force however the public commentary period ends on February 1st and unissu we expect these to be expanded the way things are looking between the U.S. and China probably so right now most people think that this move is meant to counter the U.S. restrictions on Chinese tech development as well as seen as the modern as as what people here think it's also aimed at the modernization of the Chinese military and then on top of that the Chinese have been indicating that they want to keep a grip on the EV industry as well as global supply chains and of course we have president elect trump coming into power in the next couple of weeks exactly right getting ahead of that as well uniss things we appreciate it tonight unissu in Beijing breaking news here on the House vote for speaker Emily Wilkins on Capitol Hill Emily hey Kelly so at this point we do have those two Republicans who have now voted for a candidate other than Mike Johnson we had Thomas Massie of course we knew he wasn't going to vote for Johnson he voted for Tom Emmer and now we have Ralph Norman one of the other holdout to his undecided yesterday he met with Johnson he sounded optimistic but said he wasn't there yet he has now gone ahead and voted for Jim Jordan we have another about five members of Republican members who they were in the chamber their names were called but they didn't say anything and so what's going to happen then is that the clerk will be going back to their names when they are done we'll see if they vote present if they vote for someone else if they vote for Johnson clearly this is a strategy we just don't exactly know at this point and of course there are still some other members who have been holdouts for Johnson including congressman chiproy they haven't gotten to vote yet their names are further back in the alphabet but at this point it is looking like we are going to be going on to a second roll call vote of course nothing is final until the gavill falls anyone can change their vote but at this point it does not looking good for Mike Johnson and it's looking like those promises that he made before going into the chamber with having a working group to work with doves to cut spending might not be enough at this point Kelly so if I heard you correctly there you said it was Ralph Norman from South Carolina who was another no vote on this bringing that to now are they going to continue the roll call all the way through Emily and then start another round how does it work yeah so they'll continue the roll call all the way through I mean technically members can continue to change their votes until the gavill falls so nothing is final however again at this point with kind of these five members Republican holdouts who are just not voting and will vote then at the end plus the two who have already come out and voted for someone other than Johnson things aren't looking good Johnson would need a small miracle for him to work out on the first roll call after that Johnson can decide whether to take a break go back to his office maybe needs with the holdouts or he could decide to just go ahead into that second roll call vote and see how he does there so we'll be paying very close attention to the rest of this roll call to what the final roll call for the first one is exactly how many folks are four or against Johnson and then figure out what the next steps are from there interestingly the market completely shrugging it off to Larry Lindsay's earlier point the doubt still up nearly 300 points without much movement on this Emily we appreciate it and we'll check back in Emily Wilkins with that update from Capitol Hill circling back to China now those stocks have been under big pressure amid ongoing tensions with the U.S. and under its own economic struggles my next guest says uncertainties about the Trump administration are keeping investors on the sidelines despite some olive branches on both sides uh Cray chair CIO Brendan A. Hurnace here Brendan welcome I mean how much is this about Trump but how much is this about a debt deflation spiral for the Chinese economy? It's certainly uh investor enthusiasm just based on their incredible outperformance of U.S. stocks over the last 15 years use to have a very very significant underway to non-US equities in general but then at same time particularly to China and I think that really is due to the concern the career risk that a professional investor would have buying Chinese stocks with the threat of Trump tariffs at the same time we don't we don't really think that's uh that campaign rhetoric will become an economic reality we don't think replicating the tariffs that led to the great depression the grapes of wrath so to speak uh we think it's this is the art of the deal and we think the Trump administration will finalize a strong deal with China who will go along with it. I you know is reading through some of the measures that the Chinese are now trying to undertake to boost the kind of I don't understand the orthodox monetary policy one obviously they've let the the currency go a little bit today um they seem to be doing a lot of stimulus measures even things like subsidizing iPhones or I'm sorry smart phones why maybe some of them are iPhones uh interesting yeah that I think one of the things that happened overnight is we had the NDRC one of the major agents government agencies in China say that they would expand the consumption subsidies that we've seen toward home appliances and auto including including electric vehicles see they're expanding the home electronics including mobile phones and we had a very strong rally overnight in Hong Kong from specific companies really the Apple ecosystem companies like AAC optical uh sunny as well as Yomi a major player in mobile phones in China competitor to to the iPhone but I'm really surprised the Apple's not rallying off of this news that you know you have the world's second largest economy is stimulating and now you're seeing that year to home electronics really should benefit not only Ali Baba but in particular JD.com JD.com is really like almost like the best buy of China online uh so we think investors are just is this a little out of sight out of mind for US and global investors of some of the real positives happening in China uh literally today it's interesting you see that as well because those are some of the individual names that David Tepper had doubled down on back when he was reducing his broad exposure to China quarter two ago and kind of looking at maybe what he's uh foresaw as some of the individual beneficiaries here I also find interesting you've you've seen a few olive branches you think so while we're just talking to Eunice about um you know some of these new um kind of punitarian measures what do you see that gives you some optimism between the two sides here well a lot of the measures that you're seeing from the outgoing Biden administration has led Beijing to show that they have some levers they can pull so you're seeing a little bit of this tit for tack going back and forth uh to Eunice's point this is all proposed which means again this is a little bit of the door is still a jar and at China we see President Trump he invited President G to the inauguration uh we think that's unlikely that a big state visit takes months to plan but I think it's a very strong signal to see vice premier Lee or Luha the trade on voy attend at a bare minimum the ambassador uh we believe well go you've also seen uh within uh the uh continuing resolution you know this big bill they got past that year end from version one to version two um when President Trump and Elon Musk go pined on the first version they pulled out the outbound China restrictions which really not many people noticed but again another significant olive branch from the from the Trump administration to Beijing and then of course you've seen some of the tick-tock news from President Trump I mean that that there's more to that than just China um obviously one of his major donors but but again that we just don't think investors are noticing some of these positives happening it's been a little frustrating for us over here at Cranches I can imagine but even if there's positives happening between these two major economies it doesn't address China's like chronic chronic structural issues and those are so big now I literally don't know how they can be fixed especially if Xi Jinping reportedly said what's the big deal about deflation yeah certainly China has to shake itself out of this debt deflationary spiral and I think they're being very conservative with implementing some of the stimulus because you know they really don't know exactly what President Trump uh what those policies will look like but they really don't have any choice Kelly they're back is up against the wall the terrible performance of the Shanghai and Shenzhen composite particularly this week is really a big thumbs down from from investors in China saying you know you got to do more and for any politician including President Xi you know when you get that thumbs down from your own investors from your own citizens that's a bad sign and so so you're starting to see moves like this NDRC it was we really do think the super tanker yeah it's starting to move it just moving very slowly all right Brendan appreciate checking in with you today been a rough stretch as mentioned for Chinese equities Brendan A hern of crane chairs coming up in video is the best performing mag 7 name this week what's old is new again uh but investors are already looking to the next catalyst for growth we could get some answers from CEO Jins and Wong's keynote address at the consumer electronics show in Vegas next week we will look ahead to that next we days at 5 a.m. be first on world markets first to the global business conversation get a jump on the investing day every day with Frank Holland success starts early worldwide exchange 5 a.m. Eastern CNBC welcome back to the exchange I'm Kate Rooney with your CNBC news update void how spokesperson John Kirby said earlier today the US is expected to announce more security assistance for Ukraine within days no additional details regarding the aid was provided but it comes after the Biden administration announced last week 5.9 billion dollars of military and financial assistance to Ukraine meanwhile the family of Eric and Lyle Menendez will meet with a Los Angeles county district attorney today in a bid to push for a reduced sentence for the brothers the family led coalition said over 20 family members will push for a re-sentencing process that reflects the brothers demonstrated rehabilitation the brothers are currently serving life in prison without parole for the murders of their parents that rocked the nation back in 1989 and the Biden administration issued final guidelines for hydrogen subsidies worth tens of billions of dollars over the next decade the rules included provision that allows companies to claim that credit to produce hydrogen in existing nuclear plants under certain conditions however some environmental groups oppose and allowing nuclear reactors to qualify for clean hydrogen credits back over to you Cal very busy here in their waning days Kate thank you very much the consumer electronics show or CES of kicks off next week in Las Vegas showcasing some of the biggest names and advances in technology AI a big focus this year dear jabosa tells us what to watch for and we have a couple of important keynotes perhaps to hear from dear drop we do one very exciting one to kick it off let me tell you about that in a moment but let me just first say that in recent years CES has lost a little bit of its shine in relevance contributing to that was covid the rise of cloud and enterprise software gimmicky or incremental updates versus the groundbreaking innovation that characterized the early days of CES this year though there is a big opportunity to revive its role in the age of AI and the elements are already there needs to capitalize on it in video CEO jensen wang he's kicking it off on Monday with a keynote he's also expected to announce a key GPU upgrade with the RTX 5000 series that's based on the new blackwell architecture now in video shares they're up nearly 7% over the last session and a half in anticipation of that keynote for the industry at large though the stakes are high the pressures on actual use cases that go beyond the AI hype last year's high profile AI releases they were devices from rabbit and humane remember that pin ultimately they underwhelmed and well flopped AI PCs they were everywhere too but shipments did last year and lackluster growth that's expected for this year adding to urgency a i's digestion phase where the focus has moved from raw innovation to integration optimization and scaling investors are becoming increasingly wary of those ballooning costs especially from the hyper scalers tied to bigger and better models they're looking for ROI in applications kelly cs could give us a taste at least what we might expect or hope for this year yeah although is there anyone beyond kind of the usual suspects i remember when a ad bastion sat with us a couple weeks ago he said that uh their delta is going to be giving uh one of the keynotes as well i know i know it's like you have people like delta CEO going have samsung i believe but they still miss some big players i mean apple stop going in an official capacity in the early 90s it doesn't mean though that you're not going to see products and applications showcase on the iphone or other apple devices i spoke to google as well they don't actually have a booth either but they're sort of talking about their google tv stuff so it still has some ways to go but all you need kelly is that one killer AI app right essentially to sort of get the wheels churning i suppose and uh we'll see if investors excitement pays off dear to thanks dear to bosa coming up today's stock market rebound likely won't be enough to save the sand to clause rally this year and while our technician isn't calling for a bear market just yet he does use them downside risk ahead for the rest of the month he'll tell us why after this welcome back we had a record year for stock buybacks in 2024 and we're already off to a strong start in 2025 and that's because corporate bond issuance is surging this month my next guest expects that to leave to even more buybacks which will keep driving stock market gains brine rentals is back with us he's the chief market strategist at rental strategy brine it's great to check in with you especially in a year where there's a lot of concern about how we're trading at high valuations and you know whatever's going to happen with uh kind of the fundamentals how are you looking at this market and expecting this kind of pretty strong performance well happy new year i think it's going to be a good year for stocks but a volatile year we're going to have a choppy earnings season coming up in a couple of weeks we've got a lot of political drama on the table we're going to have government that government shutdown battles we're going to have debt ceiling battles we're having a speaker of the house battle right now as we speak um so that's going to add to some volatility but the debt fuel buybacks are so strong that over time they will overcome that volatility and so ever that makes a lot of these selloffs a buying opportunity but you do know that we're one standard deviation above trend if we get to two then you'd kind of want to be a seller yes the buyback announcements searched in november and december we had almost half a trillion of new buyback announcements during that time so over 2020-25 that money is going to get put to work but if a push is stocks up too high to two standard deviations above trend i want to be a tactical seller but you're also going to have volatility from the forces that i just mentioned if stocks get pushed down to trend i want to be an aggressive buyer from a tactical standpoint is there anything Brian that would change kind of the corporate buyback strategy i'm thinking more of like the expiring tax package that has to be renewed and things like that or the conditions that have given rise to this phenomenon still largely in place and and do you expect companies to have the kind of capital to use to broadly do buybacks instead of a lot of the tech companies now for instance we have to use that for investing in a i we buyback are driven by public pensions and insurance companies those are the biggest investors in the world they are underfunded and they're too optimistic about yields so they have to invest aggressively in the credit market if something changes that if there's a credit crisis then we'll revise that but i actually see things getting stronger we kicked off this year with a great day after new years in the credit market with insurance companies and automakers being able to access the credit market and that tells me that the banks when after they report their earnings they're going to access the credit market and leverage its economy up more so the one thing i think could change things is to the opposite side the bi-glam administration putting a buyback tax if that gets repealed then you're going to have more buybacks that's a great point it's a tax that we barely even talk about i know it was you know not a huge amount but still do you want to less of something you tax it we've still had this boom if that goes away i can only imagine uh Bryan thanks for joining us kind of follow the dollars we really appreciate it thank you Bryan Reynolds of Reynolds strategy now let's get to the German word of the day don't go floutta don't go Christina it's having a big impact on european energy prices with both the Dutch and UK nat gas reaching its highest levels in more than a year that the Stevens is here on set with this story and is this all about the Ukraine pipeline shut downers or something else going on yeah so that's part of it but basically the context here is that european natural gas did cross above 50 euros per megawatt hour for the first time since november of 2023 as the blob draws down gas and storage at a faster than expected rate there are three key reasons for that the first is that it's been a colder start to winter especially compared to last year which was a normally warm the next is what's known as dunkel floutta which means cloudy days with low wind speeds there's been a higher than usual number of days like that meaning renewables are not performing at max capacity finally a transit agreement that saw gas flow from Russia through Ukraine and into countries like Austria and Slovakia just expired now Kepler estimates that by the end of the withdrawal season inventory and european storage will be at 44 percent down from 58.5 percent last year that means they'll need to refill at a faster pace in order to meet the mandated 90 percent threshold by november one and that insurance could boost the usl and g industry the us is already the largest lng supplier in the world supplying about half of europe's lng and by some estimates their imports will be up 18 percent year over year wow and they're building out more floating lng import capacity and so far germany's turned to Norway for a lot of its gas needs they understand it maybe australian some of those other partners are filling the gap so at what point do you think that brings energy prices or gas prices in particular down to where they were you know the good old days five six seven years ago which could really help their economy i think we have to get through the winter but this is becoming the common refrain it feels like every single winter we go in and say what are we going to get this year and that's because particularly all of their grids are now interconnected and so that means if you have this dunkel flauta phenomenon in one area it's plaguing multiple countries and so it's not as if you can tap you know your neighbor for exports and because they have added so many renewables when those are working really well that's great but then when they don't you have to call upon that gas torch and that's when prices start to accelerate but already this year we've drawn down 26 bcm that compares to 14 bcm last year and so we were already going in in a weaker than expected spot so right now the price forecast really depends on the weather quickly although it's a big question germany would they ever can they ever bring their nuclear capacity back online i mean they have gone so far in shutting them down even after russian vated ukraine they really stuck behind that and that was of course a major point behind angola merkel's mission and so it seems like it would be tough at this point i've heard some forecast say that it would take at least a decade to turn it back on yes that's what i for just because they've been on the decline and they you know weren't they weren't getting their regular maintenance and things like that because there was always this shut down moment perhaps that can be turned around we've seen things like that in moments of crisis before but it doesn't seem like they're talking about that at this moment as you noted they turned to lng instead building import facilities from the u.s bring it on all right works for me pipa thanks pipa Stevens speaking of nat gas don't miss our interview with eq t c o toby rice next hour on power lunch i'll get more into the lng boom it could be happening in this country and it's coming up at two p.m. eastern and the so-called santa claus rally kind of failing to show up this year with the s and p down about half a percent since christmas eve and while one technician isn't ready to wake the bears just yet he is worried about some near term downside ahead will dig into what he's calling the market's three body problem next welcome back the market is suffering from what my next guest calls a three body problem thanks to a strong dollar rising yields and narrow breath and he says until those conditions reverse course downside volatility for stocks will continue let's bring in johnathan crinsky the chief market technician at bt so it's like a physics thing john that i thought it was like a psychological condition well it could be both but as you mentioned kelly we've had that persistent push up in u.s dollar up thirteen of last fourteen weeks interest rates at you know in some cases whether you're looking at real or nominal rates at the highest level in two years and we had that persistent weakness in breath in december in some in some instances it was some of the weakest breath we've seen on record so yeah it's really difficult for the market to make up saying progress with one all three of those are occurring despite the fact that you know some of the heavy weights the typical heavy weights in the mag seven continue to you know hold hold their own for at this point do we need the third like if it were just the dollar and yields would that be enough to kind of be be a problem in and of its own well it's kind of i think the weak breath is a reaction to the strength in dollar and yields right and because you're seeing it impact the small caps you're seeing it impact the broad market the most whereas the mag seven tends to be the least impacted by rising interest rates we saw that you know in 2023 and part of 2024 so it's all you know correlated it's all related to each other and I think you know the hope for the bulls is that that wash out in breath that we saw in december is an opportunity and we can see we can see breath rebound we're certainly seeing it today but I think for that rally and the breath broadening to have any sustainability you really need to see rates and the dollar not only probably paused but really pull back lower and we just haven't seen any signs of that at the to this point absolutely and if Santa Claus should fail to call bears may come to broad and wall that makes me think of the late great art cash in and that gives you i mean among other conditions you're citing some reason to think we might have some near-term downside yeah so that's Santa Claus rally it's often talked about today is actually the last day of the period and barring a miraculous rally it's probably going to be a negative Santa Claus rally period now that doesn't necessarily mean you know the rest of the year is going to be awful there's been plenty of times when we've had a negative Santa Claus rally and the year has been actually pretty strong but all else equal a negative period does or tend to lower the average returns it as opposed to if the rally or positive so you have that the next indicator we're going to look at as the first five days of the year so we're actually up you know over the first two days so that's a good start so you know it's it's it's always tough to make too many calls over the first couple of this year but I think you know over the last few months the issue has been and you know really since the fed began cutting its it's cutting rates you've seen breath actually narrow as as opposed to what I think the consensus thought it would expand so that's really the the issue and that's got to resolve itself for us to move material higher kind of on the flip side of this because obviously the big tech has been where the strength is but again a little bit of a different picture the last couple days apple started out on a poor note yesterday we had guessed earlier this hour who said he was surprised it didn't trade better today in response to some of the stimulus measures that China's introducing and you think you know the after a really strong finish to the year that where would you be looking maybe for for an entry point if this correction continues yes so it's it's funny apples we highlighted this in late December it was almost too much of a good thing it had been up five consecutive weeks two percent or more each of those weeks and that historically has been a pretty bad sign for the next month meaning you just kind of pulled forward a lot of the strength and you tend to see average returns actually in the minus five to six percent range of the next month we've actually seen that over just over the last week so it's possible it kind of did a lot of the sell off just in the last week or so but I think you know apple down
