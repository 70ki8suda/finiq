The investing edge you need to start the year ahead of the game. CNBC You're listening to the Exchange. Here's today's show. All right, thanks very much Scott. Welcome to the Exchange. I'm Dominic Chiuin for Kelly Evans on this Christmas Eve eve. And here's what's ahead on the show. Gaming out Trump policies from tariffs to immigration. We look at how much of a factor it could become for the Fed and for the markets and the trades to make as a result of it. Plus from Bitcoin miner to powering artificial intelligence. Core scientific is converting part of its infrastructure to capitalize on the growing demand for data centers. But getting to this point hasn't exactly been a straight line. The CEO joins us with the risks and rewards of this latest restructuring. And Tiz the season for shopping and it looks very different from this time last year. We've got the trends and some of the unexpected winners and losers coming up ahead. You are looking at one of them by the way right behind me. Coming that name is coming up. But we're going to be with you today's markets here. And what we are seeing is relative positivity ahead of this particular holiday short and trading week. If you take a look right now what's going on with the markets, we are just about mixed on the session. But the S&P is up one third of 1% up 20 points to 59 51. Then as that composites up about two thirds of 1% pacing the advanceers right now 19,709 the Dow industrials down 60 points for just about a one tenth of 1% loss there. The Dow industrials currently at 42,783. With regard to two of the stocks and focus today so far, check out shares of both Apple and Palantir. They're lower right now just maybe fractionally so about one tenth of 1% for each of them. But both Apple and Palantir both hit record intraday highs the only 2S and P500 members to do so before turning slightly negative on the session so far. So keep going now those two record names there. Another place to watch is what's happening with the macro markets in the 10 year yield especially 4.576% so still holding above that level got to go all the way back to May, June of this past year to see levels this high. So on a year to date basis we have seen some movement to the upside in terms of yields especially off their lows. We'll see if that stays 4.574 is your last trade there. And then if you're taking a look at Bitcoin prices we mentioned them in the open there. Well we were at 108,000 just over the course of the past week and a half or so we've drifted back down to 93,438 that's off roughly 2% right now but still it's been a staggering move higher especially since the elections. So keep it on Bitcoin prices we'll have much more on that story coming up later on this hour. Now we learned last week that some of the Fed got to jump on gaming out the potential effects of policies from the incoming Trump administration. Senior economic support of Steve Leesman is here with what that could mean for the rate cut trajectory in 2025 Steve. Hey Dom yeah to a limited extent Fed officials are doing what investors across Wall Street are doing which is plugging in at least some numbers for the potential effect of policies yet to be proposed from the incoming Trump administration. Here's how Fed Chair Jay Powell put it in last week's press conference describing what committee members actually did. Some people did take a very preliminary step and start to incorporate highly conditional estimates of economic effects of policies into their forecast at this meeting and said so in the meeting. Some people said they didn't do so and some people didn't say whether they did or not. So we got a little more detail on Friday and CNBC interviews, paragraph as an awesome goose me telling us that his rate path is a little more shallow due to uncertainty and potential policies. New York Fred President John Williams said he accounted for things that look like they're obviously coming some slowing in immigration as well as tariffs. So in the face of higher inflation prints and uncertain fiscal policy next year 15 members writing down that they now see the inflation risk to the upside that compared with just three in September how to tariffs affect potential policy. Well tariffs and even retaliatory tariffs could raise price levels but not necessarily the inflation rate. So you may end up having to look through the inflation rate penciled in by the Fed. The increase of level of uncertainty obviously and they could delay rate cuts until inflation the inflation rate in fact becomes more clear. All we know now is that some federal officials have called it a down payment on the potential policy effects if they're wrong there could be upside to the hawkish outlook that we got at the last meeting but there's also potential downside if the effects end up being more extreme down. All right. So Steve let's talk a little bit about how the markets and in whatever way they are are positioned for the rate movement trajectory for the Fed this coming year if those risks are still in place. But seem as though from a market perspective we are in a good spot where the Fed can respond in any way shape or form to those increasing threats. Does there need to be a situation where panic ensues or do we feel as though just holding off on rate cuts is good enough for a rising inflationary threat if that were to happen? You know Dom I think that's an excellent question actually really well asked because it shows that the Fed has three things it can do. It can cut a little more slowly it can hold and then in the last instance I think is when they might actually raise rates. So I think the way you ask that question is exactly right for how the Fed is thinking about it and let me just be clear there's two things at play here. The first is the higher than expected inflation numbers we got or the stalling of inflation that happened through the fall that affected Fed policy and then to another extent was the layering in of these potential policies from the administration and what you heard is that if you listen to what Austin said he's like well it may be I may to go shallower not necessarily getting rid of rate cuts and then if you look at how the market is priced very similar to how the Fed is thinking about this they have one cut built in next year and another one they're kind of thinking about if you look at that that December second cut it's below you maybe get up to 50% if you look out to January of 2026 but they are not sure about that cut just the way I think the Fed is not sure about that second cut. I know Steve that more and more of the conversations I have with investors and traders out there center around just what that reaction could be if the inflationary threat looms again. So Steve thank you very much for the report there let's use that to dovetail into our next guest here both say that there's maximum noise in the market due to the speculation about a Trump 2.0 administration but their playbooks for the new year differ just ever so slightly. Joining me now are David Harden the CEO and chief investment officer over some at global investments also Jenny Harrington the CEO and portfolio manager over at Gilman Hill asset management she's also of course you see her often a CMBC contributor thank you both for being here right now Jenny will start with you you just heard Steve's report I wonder how much of the market action next year I know it has to be driven in some way maybe even largely so by the Fed but how important is it and is it noise in your mind. It's noise and I think that noise ends up creating chaos so it's funny thinking about coming on and then listening to Steve where he's saying things like there's inflation risk to the upside and uncertain fiscal policy and I'm thinking you know tariffs and who's going to be in the cabinet and massive wars overseas and when I hear all that I think chaos and as an investor I have a really mixed response to that because on the one hand it hurts portfolio returns makes clients very uncomfortable on the other hand it creates amazing opportunity and the best investment investments I've ever made have come from chaotic time periods so I'm kind of excited about next year even though it's with a perverse lens. You know it's interesting David it doesn't seem like chaos right now despite some of the recent volatility we've seen in the wake of the last Fed rate decision largely we're still near record highs and it's been a nice march higher throughout the course of the last year what exactly is your outlook in 2025 given the fact that we've already seen massively positivity massive positivity in the markets over the past 12 to 24 months. Well I appreciate that Dom I can I can sense Jenny's positive or cautious optimism and I'm very cautiously optimistic about 2025 the Fed definitely did something last week you know it was first we don't guess we don't speculate we don't assume and now it's well we do and so this fiscal policy tariff news there's going to be a lot of I think short term volatility in the first half of 2025 but that's going to create opportunity and I do see some really great opportunities. Thioations are stretched but I think we can focus on what I call defensive growers or defensive growth this is companies that can really defend their higher valuations if you will and there's some other things that we can do for 2025 that can make a difference in our portfolios. David Jenny I'm going to have you both hold on from one second we've got some breaking news right now the two year note auction is up and the results are in Rick Santelli's tracking the action in the bond market from the CME Rick over to you. Yes and that's why yields are moving a bit lower Dom let's go through it 69 billion the first leg of a three leg refunding from the Treasury totally 183 billion tomorrow we'll have five years a day after Christmas we'll have seven years the yield 4.335 very close to the when issued market so it priced pretty good and if you look at all the metrics well they're all close to an average but there is one anomaly here the anomaly is we had 82.1 indirects and 6.6 directs now if you add them together it's 88.7 which is pretty good but I rarely see these types of splits and I think it's because of the holidays whatever reason direct bidders those bidders are insurance companies pension funds they laid low but foreign entities going through primary dealers at 82.1 was a record and they definitely showed up dealers took 11.3 percent of the auction Dom that's less than a 13 percent 10 auction average the grade for this auction demand wise b is a boy and I do think that you're going to continue to see pretty good action for the auctions for the rest of the year as many of course want to buy into the turn at the end of the year back to you all right Rick sent out with the latest action there thank you very much it seems like again David and Jenny dealers did not have to take down as much of the offer then they had to I mean they have to bid at these things but it seems like other investors out there whether they're director indirect bidders have done it so I guess maybe David I'm going to follow up with you is the two year note auction or any bond auction for that matter noise in your mind um in some respects yes I think that we have to keep our eye on the longer picture and not become too focused on short term trading and have a little bit of a longer term approach but this year that this is an online economy we have trade policy problems that we're going to have to work through we have federal debt that we're going to have to work through we have geopolitical risks we have inflation so this brings in these yields in these these auctions and so there's a lot that we have to shift through this year but the reality is there's a great some great opportunities out there Jenny let's talk about the great opportunities in your mind what are the picks that you have out there and why okay so you know dumb before you said it doesn't seem too chaotic well that's only at the top level and that's what the market being still up 24% but the minute you dive below that I am telling you it is chaos and whether and I'll get to my picks because they represent this exactly but whether you look at different sectors right you've got you've got materials down 12% this quarter and consumer discretionary up 16 that's wild so we've added new positions to all three of our strategies in the past couple weeks we added canagra which is now trading at about 10 times earnings 5% earnings growth ahead 5% yield why because RFK was nominated to H.A.S. and everyone thought oh he's going to attack all big food you and by the way the stock was down 5% on the year so markets up 24% canagras down 5 we added Honda Motors this is crazy to our international strategy last week Honda's down 15% on the year look at this doctor that they plunged after the election because tariffs right meanwhile tariffs have very little to no impact on Honda's actual business and it's got a 5% 5.7% dividend yield 15% for cash so it's got 50% of its cash of its market cap and cash and it has 5% to 10% earnings growth ahead and then lastly in our growth strategy last week we added TripAdvisor another one impacted by nothing due to the fault of its own company this is not a dividend yield there but a 14% for cash for yield 15 to 20% earnings growth ahead down almost 50% for the year when we bought it why because there was an overhang of risk from Liberty Media ownership on it so that's what I mean when like beneath the surface there's chaos and from that you can make hey it is not it is not a collectively rosy picture out there crisis equals danger and opportunity so David let's talk about your picks where do you see them and why sure let me let me bring it up to some of the mag 7 that a lot of people have that exposure to right now I would say that one of the things that I would do in the mag 7 is try to separate out kind of some winners from the losers going forward and so my buys right now would kind of stay in the apple and the google and the meta area I think that they have some very very justifiable valuations I think that you can see the growth there in all of those companies and really feel comfortable owning those companies going into 2025 but one I would probably stay away from a little bit is Tesla Tesla has a 65 PE and let's face it you can wait for Elon Musk he's going to let you know when it's the right time to get in um he's going to signal to you so for right now I would definitely be avoiding Tesla but I would be getting into some of these others or look for opportunities in Tesla if the stock falls too much and Elon speaks up so this is kind of some mag 7 opportunities for people all right David Hardin and Jenny Harrington thank you both very much happy holidays you both will see you soon thank you all right meanwhile a government shutdown has been averted but the drama in DC may just be getting started Emily Wilkins is live in Washington DC with a look at the challenges that the GOP will face going forward and Frank Holland with the president elect's latest threat taking control of the Panama Canal and what the implications are for the global supply chain Emily we will start with you first hey Dalmyah congress managed to avoid that shutdown but the messy process to get there really shut a lot of light on how difficult much some of the must pass bills next congress are going to be for republicans that includes raising the debt limit which is currently suspended but remember the clock is going to begin taking on January 2nd experts believe that lawmakers are going to have until the summer to either raise or suspend the debt limit meanwhile republicans struck a handshake agreement to raise the debt limit 1.5 trillion using a process that won't require democrats and then cut spending by 2.5 trillion now to do that lawmakers likely need to find some cuts and programs like netiCare and medicaid but before any of that congress is going to need to elect a speaker the mike johnson has the backing of trump and most of his conference but even a few lawmakers could deny johnson the majority that he needs to actually get the gavill congressman kory mills said republicans have grown frustrated with how many times johnson has had to work with democrats to pass major legislation i'm losing confidence with each day and i think that we have a lot of our colleagues are losing confidence we're not sticking to the principles and the values in which we say that we fight for trump is also adding more names to his cabinet he nominated hedge fund strategist Stephen maran to lead his council of economic advisors and billionaire hospitality owner and he's in rocket's owner tillman fritia to be ambassador to italy and of course we're going to be seeing a lot more discussion uh dom early next year as some of trump's cabinet picks get their senate hearings and then a vote once trump is sworn in come all right changing dynamic here in the first couple of months in twenty twenty five in the congress of the america thank you very much for the emily uh while the president elect doesn't just have a different approach to diplomacy on capital hill but he also has that same approach with sovereign countries as well he's actually floating the idea that the u.s. should retake control of the panamokan al frank holland has more on the why and the what it would do to the supply chain frank where they're done you know panamokan al is you just mentioned the latest target for the trump agenda so ships moving cargo to and from the u.s. they make up about three quarters of the volume at the panamokan al and now the president elect is demanding the rates be lowered or he's essentially threatening to repossess the panamokan al we will demand that the panamokan al be returned to the united states of america in full quickly and without question not going to stand for it so to the officials of panamok please be guided accordingly you can google how the canal got transferred to panamokan al is get to the sticking point here canal fees they can be as high as three hundred thousand dollars according to reports we've reached out to canal authorities but so far no response however the president of panamokan al is certainly responding is that with a video emphasizing he has no plans to comply he even holds the transfer documents in the video he goes on the same part every square meter of the panamokan al and it's surrounding areas belongs to panamokan al and we'll continue to do so the sovereignty and independence of our country are non-negotiable mr trump firing back on true social seeming to maintain his demands you kept it pretty short and sweet he says we'll see about that all right this back and forth certainly making some headlines for investors but the bigger supply chain issue for the new administration it may actually be a two week period in January east and golf port operators in longshoreman they've said in january 15 deadline to reach a new contract deal without one we could see a strike the president elect is also promised tariffs on an auguration day that's january the 20th and then we also get an earlier than normal lunar new year now historically there's a rush of freight about two weeks before the holiday you just do the math right around the time of that port strike we could see also a rush of imports into the us and then later we could see tariffs that would continue to shift the supply chain down is there any indication frank that we would even come close to any of the supply chain chaos that we saw over the last couple of years in the wake of the pandemic just given the tariff rhetoric and now the panamokan al rhetoric as well you know that that's a really great question now I've been talking to so many supply chain executives and CEOs a lot of them say that freight has already started to shift from the east to the west coast ports out of concerns for the strike obviously tariffs would hit you at any port you're at if you add that influx of volume from lunar new year I don't think anybody really knows what to expect it's kind of a perfect storm when it comes to supply chain would it be as bad as the pandemic unlikely but certainly outside the pandemic and maybe one of the bigger supply chain events of our time all right frank column with the latest there thank you very much for that coming up on the show mna is returning to retail our next guest says that north strom going private may be the latest but not the last retailer going that private route and there are two names cc's following suit coming up next he joins us with that and some of the unexpected holiday retail winners out there plus it is a holiday tradition cmc.com's Alex Sherman got media executives to give him their predictions anonymously of course for the coming year Alex joins us with the boldest and biggest ideas in that media landscape coming up ahead exchange is back in two minutes this is the exchange on cnbc it's cnbc's big January with ces from los vegas biotech and pharma at jpm health care the world economic forum in Davos and the first fed decision of the year start the year ahead of the game cnbc. Welcome back to the exchange as you're seeing their shares of north strom are lower after the company announced plans to go private the all cash deal is expected to close in the first half of the new year and it is valued at more than six billion dollars now it's funded by north strom's founding family and also a mexican retailer liverpool our next guest says we could see mna return to retail as leanachon exits and the ftc chair roll gets moved on and things that may sees or coals could be the next on the block to consolidate joining me now to discuss retail in 2025 is jan niffin ceo a j rogers niffin worldwide a former department store executive and that's where we're going to start the department store landscape the north strom news maybe isn't shocking they've been talking about this for years now jan so what exactly are the implications for north strom and their investors and their family well i think this is great if you're the north from family and i think if you want to restructure some of your business you want to do it in a private environment the kind of families wanted to buy them out for like you said years now we see falling interest rates we see what's going to be a more favorable environment in general for mna i think and i think we'll certainly see this one get done and you just said that i think we could see a better environment for mna i think we're going to see a better environment for mna we've got falling interest rates and we're going to have a friendlier doj for retail we may not have for tech but we do for retail so i certainly think that macy's that people have been driving trying to buy out since i tried to buy them out in 1988 and i think that coal that produces lots of cash flow but doesn't have much of an asset base could certainly be bought out as well because both of those are struggling retailers and could be restructured much more easily as private companies and there's interest and now there's an environment where you can probably borrow the money so yes i i think we're going to see mna ramp up here tapestry will probably be back in the game maybe now we buy pieces of capri instead of all of capri but i bet that we see some mna interest there as well Jan how much of this anticipated mna activity this consolidation activity is going to be born of perhaps necessity as opposed to the desire to want to do something like that how much of this is going to be because retailers have to do it to consolidate in order to stay alive most of it's born out of necessity the three we just talked about really do need to be private right and i think we'll see more of that going on because you know wallmart, Costco, Home Depot and Dixporting Goods kind of own the world right now and we're seeing all this market share gained by wallmart so if you're another retailer you're already looking around going wow how do i stay relevant how do i keep myself in the game getting bigger is very helpful because right now in retail you need to be big, well-capitalized and willing to reinvest in the business especially using technology and AI. So those charts that we're showing for guys like wallmart and Costco are big and they're moving from the lower left to the upper right so that's a good sign where else do we see winners in this retail landscape going into 2025 Jan? well you're going to see quite a few winners you're going to see the four i just named to be winners right but you're still going to see real interest in luxury starting back because the consumer at the luxury level is going to be healthier in the US and i actually think we're going to see some reflation in china and if we do luxury could get a little better there so then you have to look at people like LVMH and Prada right but anybody else in that luxury space and then i think the near luxury guys you know like the Ralph Lauren's and the tapestries good brands, Lilliliman, Nike for instance they're going to be very interesting too because we're seeing an interest in apparel and accessories and we're also seeing the ability of the higher end consumer to spend and that's just going to get better it looks like in 2025 we're still struggling down at the low end that consumer's still struggling they're still dealing with 24% more than they were spending in 2019 to buy the same stuff and that's putting a lot of pressure on them when you get above that and the top couple of quintiles there's real ability to spend here and it's just going to get better especially if we see tax rates change we're probably not going to see tax rates go up so my guess is as long as jobs remain healthy here we're going to see more value coming into real estate people are going to be able to use home equity again i think we're going to see strength in luxury and near luxury all right now i want to do this because we did show our viewers out there and listeners would have been paying attention on the series xm we had teased this idea of a mystery chart a potential winner out there i'd like to go through the story behind our mystery chart gen and why you think this retailer is a winner i don't see your mystery chart out there well okay i'm going to put it up there and that right there is tractor supply tractor supply is up about 25% so far year to date but you think maybe this is a stock that could see momentum to the upside well i think both food bar and tractor supply are benefiting from that strange phenomenon we've seen for several years now which is western country country gentlemen all of that stuff is very very strong and maybe we thought it would start to fade at some point in time but there is no evidence of that happening so that whole ethos continues to be strong and i kind of thought wow maybe we jumped as sharp when Beyonce went country but we didn't it just made it get bigger again so i think that whole part of the business i think kc's general story even benefits from this whole concept tractor supply does but certainly boot barn does and i think they're showing really straight here for the fourth quarter and i think they will into 2025 so yeah i'm really excited about that side of the business especially for some of those smaller players but it's tough being a smaller player right now i'm retail and of course all of this is Taylor Sheridan's yellow stone hit series comes to an end jennif and thank you very much for the boot trade and the tractor trade have happy holidays sir thank you all right coming up on the show it's not just competition that could change the chips landscape next year so are geopolitics we've got the latest and a look at who is well positioned for gains and we're not talking about just Nvidia that's coming up next get a head start on 2025 with cnvc's big January the hottest tech event ces from los magus the data the jobs report and meet the future of biotech and pharma at jpm health care check out the mx golf tournament from california inauguration day and the meeting of world leaders in Davos plus the first fed decision of the year the investing edge you need to start the year ahead of the game cnvc welcome back to the exchange i'm pipa stevens and this is your cnvc news update nbraska governor jim pilin was hospitalized yesterday after he was thrown off a horse his office says he was riding on horseback with family members when he was bucked off a new horse and was injured governor pilin is alert and is expected to stay in the hospital in omaha for several days sweetens foreign minister says china has denied a request for prosecutors to conduct an investigation on a chinese ship suspected of intentionally cutting two undersea cables in the balktic sea the news comes as bejewing pledge to cooperate with local authorities the ship named e-peng3 was boarded by swedish police and other authorities last week and x is raising prices for its top tier u.s subscriptions by nearly 40 percent the change came into effect over the weekend the elan musk owned platform said the increase would fuel content creator payouts hikes com as x dropped ads from its premium subscription down back to you all right thank you very much pipa stevens for that news update increase competition already impacting chips right now and that's expected to continue into twenty twenty five but the bigger risk could be geopolitical in nature with tywan as the major headwind in twenty twenty five our cema moody has been here and reporting on what to expect for today's tech check cema well done and vidia's competitive landscape you could say is certainly evolving real time broadcom aggressively working to sign up new silk and valley tech giants as customers like open a i and apple are looking to develop their own customized chips however when it pertains to AMD which has sort of been seen as a main competitor to in video Morgan Stanley analysts are sitting out on this one they're not a believer and it coincides with new research out today from industry heavyweight semi-analysis that looks at how AMD software compares to Nvidia and they found that Nvidia scored much well or well above AMD some of the wild cards bank of america is watching into twenty twenty five sentiment around AI China's recovery and the prospect of tariffs now president elect trump has already threatened to put tariffs on tywan semiconductor the main manufacturer of cutting edge chips and experts say tywan could potentially be a bargaining chip in us china trade negotiations i think we will see president trump take a hard line on china but on tywan and other issues of china's concern we will see a less hard line from trump then we saw during the Biden administration uh Biden stated unequivocally on four occasions if china attacks tywan the united states will defend it president trump has already walked back that statement Christopher ads that if president elect trump makes a deal with russia and allows part of Ukraine to be annex that couldn't bold in china to make a move on tywan so that's why the sector is so vulnerable to foreign policy how likely would it be for anything like that to happen in the first year of a trump administration when you could argue that any political entity in the world will be trying to feel out what exactly a trump administration two point i was going to look like yeah at this point as we had that conversation with the lanta council's fellow uh mark rista for very low risk of any type of invasion into tywan it's still a potential risk that was nearly not on the table for the last four years now something that they'll be watching very closely as we see these discussions continue between the united states in china and how tywan could factor into those discussions all right see mimo de with the latest on the chip industry thank you very much for that now coming up on the show netflix is the standout media stock so far this year it's up eighty seven percent while disney is gained a respectable twenty three percent but the names going through big changes like paramount concast our parent company for now and water brothers discovery are all down on the year we'll look at what media executives themselves expect to see in the new year and how the landscape should shift even further in twenty twenty five that story is coming up next welcome back to the exchange has been a big year for media deals and shakeups as well most recently with our own parent company concast as well as water brothers discovery both announcing corporate structure overholes so what exactly will twenty twenty five bring joining me now to discuss this is mountain CEO mark Douglas alongside with our cmbc dot com media and sports reporter Alex Sherman gents thank you very much for being here both of you Alex is by the way annual list of predictions from anonymous media executives is out on cmbc dot com today so go to the website and check out that story uh... maybe Alex we're going to start with you on setting the stage for what twenty twenty five could potentially look like if this predictive reporting that you've been doing from the executives comes to fruition look the list is a little bit skewed because i told all of the media executives be bold with this so there it's probably a little bit more aggressive than what will happen but there's definitely a couple themes you can pull away from it one is that executive expect m in a to come roaring back in the media and it's an entertainment industry in twenty twenty five it's not that it's completely gone away but you know the last year or two things have been a little bit slower than what it was prior to that uh... there's a lot of hope that the trump administration will bring a softer regulatory regime which will lead to consolidation with our parent company uh... with Warner Brothers discovery with fox potentially all of those companies were mentioned in a variety of different agreements of course we've already seen one deal with paramount global merging with skydance media if that deal is approved next year it's also possible that that company could quickly turn around and divest assets so that also may be an m in a part so that's one beam the other one i would say is look this has been ongoing now for years but it's always a parlor game to figure out who's going to take over for bob i so a couple CEOs weighed in with their predictions there uh... one surprise maybe a turn around from last year or several executives that gain a wall then would be named uh... bob i hear success or now one executive coming out and saying wall then won't be named his successor and in fact will leave the company by the end of twenty twenty five so that's a pretty bold prediction on that all right so the person who's not anonymous in this reporting right now is mark Douglas who's the CEO for a mountain now mark i guess you're on the record here you're you're you're out there for everybody to see and listen to right now what do you think is going to be the biggest thing in your mind that changes the landscape for media in twenty twenty five well i think it's a couple things i definitely agree there is likely to be a lot of m in a what kind of has to happen you either have to remain relatively small but have a very specialized product that consumers the entertainment consumers really love well you have to go really big which is a massive catalog that you know people want it when they turn on the tv as the you're the first place they want to go so um so that's going to lead to a lot of consolidation so i think that's definitely true i do think going back to the disney prediction it has to be someone with a really strong knowledge of streaming that the company is there all the media companies that are going to survive or like all in on streaming so i don't see disney going to kind of uh older i don't mean age wise but more traditional law you know kind of media executive i think they're going to go to someone who really really understands the streaming business and likely someone already within the company i think mark uh we consider you an expert on streaming and digital media your company mountain does a lot of targeted advertising when it comes to things like connected televisions and the the way people stream through through different types of products i wonder if you could kind of tell us a little bit about what you think the media and advertising market does look like for this coming year as well can we expect to see some kind of growth there with regard to digital marketing and how it's targeted towards consumers of connected televisions yeah i think you will and and for the reasons you stated but it could take a bit longer so essentially everyone knows the industries and the transition but the part i don't think everyone is how much the sales organizations of these companies are transitioning the streaming first which is meaning data first targeted first like the days of picking shows um this is not the year upfronts are going to disappear but we're in a path to upfronts don't matter as much it's all about you know if even the largest brands who's the exact consumer i'm trying to reach wherever they're watching tv so there's this big push towards you know essentially truly targeted advertising even for the big large brand advertisers and i think that is going to lead to a lot of growth it's going to get the big advertisers to spend more and it's going to what we mountain's been doing has been drawing in the small and midsize advertisers into the television market for the first time i think the combination is going to lead to a lot of growth for a lot of for a lot of media companies all right Alex just a few moments left right now as a media reporter what's the biggest thing that you're watching for in 2025 i think the biggest media and sports stories the launch of yes pn's flagship streaming service uh when that launches which is going to be around august of 2025 it's at least possible that hundreds of thousands billions of people over the next several months cancel cable now that yes pn is available for the first time out of the if that happens it will just be yet another cataclysmic event to the cable tv landscape and it's no wonder that you see concast now spinning out its cable networks, Warner Brothers discovery splitting its company into two separating cable from the rest of the business we know that that's going to be a bad event for the cable landscape we just don't know how bad so that's something i'm definitely keeping my eye on for 2025 and mark the same question to you for the last word biggest thing you're watching in 2025 um i think what what was just said is a really important point the espn it you know basically being truly available on streaming is a big deal so i'll also going to generate a lot of bad dollars but i think going back to my previous point i think that the debt that it's going to be the year that starts the death of the upfront that the it's just not going to be as important in 2025 leading and also leading into 2026 all right the paradigm shift is afoot mark doggalus the mountain ceo thank you very much alex sherman or cmvc dot com media and sports reporter happy holidays to you both thanks all right coming up on the show new home sale surge in november as prices fell to their lowest in more than two years but that's not enough to get the i shares home construction ETF out of negative territory down slightly today taylor morison the best performing holding up about a percent the exchange is back after this all right coming up on the show shares of core scientific as you're seeing there up more than 300 percent but that merged from bankruptcy earlier this year so there is a little bit of context the bitcoin miner entered chapter 11 back in 2022 after crypto prices plunged but it's back in a big way and its transformation continues we're going to talk to the ceo about the companies a i ambitious coming up next welcome back to the exchange despite last week's big drop after the feds hawkish outlook for twenty twenty five bitcoin prices have more than doubled this year up roughly a hundred and ten percent now a very different story from just two years ago with the cryptocurrency fell by around sixty four percent that plunged miners and exchanges into bankruptcy protection including core scientific after one of its biggest clients now defunct crypto lender cell seas holdings couldn't pay its massive power bills but the companies emerging from bankruptcy earlier this year and is now using its digital infrastructure to accommodate another industry with high power demands and that's artificial intelligence so joining me now for more is Adam Sullivan the CEO of core scientific Adam thank you very much for being here i just laid out some of the context for our viewers and listeners around just the kind of moves that your stock is seen can you take us through what it's been like over the last year to take your bitcoin mining presence and then gradually shifted over towards artificial intelligence yeah first thanks for having me on you know for us at core scientific really have to look back at our roots as a company we started with data center industry veterans and we built one of the largest bitcoin mining infrastructure companies across North America and so we've taken that same team now ported them over to the artificial intelligence world and that's made a world of difference for our company this transition we've signed some of the largest data center contracts in twenty twenty four across any data center company so it's completely changed core scientific we're looking forward to continuing to grow the high performance computing segment looking forward in 2025 has it been a seamless transition to kind of pivot a little bit more away from that bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining operation towards artificial intelligence services for some of those bigger clients out there and what exactly does the resource reallocation look like from a corporate perspective yeah from a corporate perspective you know this is a reallocation of our development resources so all of our development time is now focused on building out new sites and winning new clients in the high performance computing space our company has completely changed over 800 megawatts of our infrastructure where we're developing some of the largest high performance computing sites in North America and potentially the world as well which is something that we're really excited about we just announced our Denton Texas facility which is actually going to be one of the largest super computers in the United States what exactly has been the biggest challenge for a company like core scientific to ramp up or change its business model to accommodate this AI demand and it has been surging in all honesty yeah it all comes down to the team you know all of the hyper scalars and large enterprises that are looking for data center capacity are looking for experienced teams that can handle the infrastructure development side because this is something that is completely overwhelming to all of these large tech companies they're building so many data centers and so many different locations that they need to have an experienced team that they can trust and if you think about it you know 100 megawatt facility over a billion dollars in infrastructure so these are large investments from these large tech companies and they're not just going to hand them to any type of company that doesn't have experiencing developing some of these large and next generation data centers Adam we just showed a graphic about the power demand coming from your AI side of the business versus the power demand from the cryptocurrency side of things and in the next say maybe one to three years how exactly do you see that trajectory moving is it going to be keeping on in that same trajectory moving away from Bitcoin and crypto mining and much more towards AI or do you consider yourself seeing at least a large portion of your business relatively speaking still dedicated to crypto mining you know today we've announced we have 900 megawatts that are dedicated to AI that's something that's going to continue to grow into the future you know when you look more broadly at this industry you know by 2030 many of the industry experts are saying that the demand for power just in the United States from the data center industry is going to more than double and so that means that we have a great runway ahead of us to be
