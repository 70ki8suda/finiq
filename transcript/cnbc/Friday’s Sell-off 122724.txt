The investing edge you need to start the year ahead of the game. CNBC You're listening to the Exchange. Here's today's show. Thank you very much, Frank, and welcome to the Exchange. I'm Kelly Evans, and we have a pretty big sell-off on our hands today. A market change from yesterday's sleepier session. Big tech is getting pounded. All the mag seven names are lower, and they're shaving more than 200 points off the Nance Deck 100. We'll take a look at why. Bitcoin is also falling down about a percent and weighing on Coinbase and Robinhood. Nizuho's Dan Dolev says one of these names is seeing a big shift in retail crypto trading. He'll tell us the one he expects to keep gaining share. Plus the market is only expecting two rate cuts next year. But one retail analyst says that might be enough to spur the housing market. She names this beaten down stock down about 5% this year. As one of her top picks, we'll reveal it and the two other names she likes coming up. That's our mystery chart today. First let's dig in today's sell-off though. Stocks and yields are lower, so you can't blame yields for a reason. As we look to round out the holiday short and trading week, Bob Asani is a look at the... Why we're seeing these rotation hopes may be still alive for next year. Rick Santelli is tracking the bond action out in Chicago. It's great to check in with both of you this afternoon. Bob kicked things off. What's behind the sell-off? Well, what we have here today is a very good example of what happens when all of a sudden there is a lack of buying interest. There is no particular headline responsible for this decline that we're seeing today. There is not a sudden surge of selling interest. No big catalyst for the drop. What we have is just a lack of buying interest here. So if you look at the major ETFs that are used tactively to trade in the market like the S&P ETFs, there's no big surge in volume particularly here. So again, this is just a little bit of a lack of buying interest. And some people may decide to lighten up on their tech positions here. So these see the S&P 500 there. Our Santa Claus rally is not looking very great here folks. We closed Monday, 59.74. So the tendency for the market to rise in the last five days and the first two days of the new year is the Santa Claus rally. You have to be above 59.74 and we're below that as you see. So Santa Claus is not looking that great. The Dow is weak because of tech. Microsoft and Salesforce and Amazon, Apple, those four, they're probably more than 200 points in the Dow. And that of course is affecting the NASDAQ as well. If you look at sectors here, you can see that it's the tech oriented sectors, technology consumer discretionary because you've got Amazon and Tesla in there, communications because you've got alphabet in there. And then you go down the list, a little less damage when you start getting into more defensive sectors like consumer staples and health care. So look at big cap tech as Kelly referenced here, Palantir, one of the big names of the year is down probably the most in the S&P today. Declines there and video, Microsoft, Broadcom right across the board. And even when you look at smaller stuff, we used to call this speculative technology, the road crews of the world and the Robin Hoods of the world. They're also also down varying degrees on the day here. Consumer staples here, naturally there's this classic tendency when you're selling off gross stocks to have modest gains and consumer staples. So in a sense, this is a very common playbook here overall. As for 2024, 2025 Kelly, Megatap tech earnings growth is going to still be very strong, but not as strong as it was in 2024. And so there's a lot of people who are very, very hopeful that we might see some kind of rotation out of some of the mega cap tech names that we've been seeing and maybe into the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 Kelly. How much do you make of trading days like this Bob? So we're going to be down sharply if we stay where we are, but it's a thin trading session. Yet it's during the Santa Claus ride. I mean, is this meaningful information, for instance, if the S&P goes below the 50 day, I don't think we're going to look back and say, well, but it was, you know, it was December 27th. Yeah, I don't put too much stock in store in this. It is somewhat understandable to see people rotating out at the end of the year into some of their major winners, like Palantir and Broadcom and Nvidia and into slightly more defensive sectors. We have been arguing about this rotation story for ages and ages. We get moments where it happens for a few weeks and then it falls apart again. Arguably, you can make a very clear argument from a valuation perspective that sectors like health care, materials, industrials are far more fairly valued than technology stocks. This has been the classic value argument. The problem is it's not working. It hasn't been working for a decade for whatever reason. Investors are preferring growth names over classic value names. So look, look here. And this is the estimates for 2025 and video is going to have a 50% increase. It was up 120%. These are earnings, not prices, earnings expectations and look at Broadcom. That's going to be up to Amazon. These are still really strong earnings. Can you get people to say, okay, guys, we've had enough. The earnings are still strong, but they're decelerating. Can you make that argument to people out there who've been used to holding on to these stuff? These things for years now and say, guys, health care is undervalued. Materials are undervalued and they are going to have very nice earnings increases next year. But not perhaps as much as the technology names. Let me just show you what the Magnificent 7 is for this quarter. We are expecting 24% growth in the fourth quarter for the Magnificent 7 stocks. Now that's great. Next year, at the same time, the expectations are only 18%. You see, still good, but it's decelerating. How about the other 493? Right now in the fourth quarter of 2024, the earnings are 4%. This is the rest of the S&P for this quarter. That's what the earnings growth is. Next year, that same 493, the expectations are 14. You see, well, that's growing. That's good. We want that, right? Yes, all good, but that's not anything close to what we're seeing in the technology names. So look, in theory, technology is the leader for, this is the earnings growth for 2025. But look, healthcare is still there and industrials are still there and materials are getting great a bump up next year. But it's really difficult to get investors interest in that. And of course, this is what makes everybody nuts, the value people nuts. By the way, Kelly, people ask me, why are we expecting corporate profits up 15% this year? Well, just look at what we've got here. The economy's growing at 3%. Companies still have high prices they've been able to have since COVID. That we have much better cost controls. AI is helping companies make be more efficient. And finally, look at this net profit margin, up 12%. Not only are they making more money, the profits, but the amount they're keeping from the revenues is higher. That's what a net profit margin is. That's 12%. Kelly, that's near an all-time record. When you get prices up and profit margins at all-time records, this is one of the great handoffs of all time you could ever possibly have for a next year's stock market. It doesn't get much better than that in terms of it. And that's why the market's so strong. Bob, thank you. At least most days, maybe not today, Bob Bessani. Rick, over to you, I don't think it was wholesale inventories this morning that spooked the market, but you tell me. Now, I think wholesale inventories were a bit of a drag. And I think that there's a bit of a light volume or it's the markets today. But let's really look. Bob didn't think there was any specific headline that made stocks all very deep shade of red. I may disagree a bit. Look at a 10-year chart. Okay? We are closing most likely today at the highest yield since, well, the end of May. But we're only about seven basis points away from the highest yields of the year, which were April at 4.7%. So we're creeping up. Right now, should we close here? We'd be up nine basis points on the week on a 10. But we'd be unchanged on a two-year. So anybody who's really looking at central banks is being the big topic for 2025. Certainly we're going to be talking about them. Certainly we're going to be scratching our head. But long-dated treasury yields, long-dated yields across the globe are moving higher. And that is something to pay attention to. It's based on that. It's most likely because of issuance. Look at a 10-year guild. It's near the mid-460s. It's looking to close at the highest yield since 2008. Look at a JGB in Japan. Japanese government behind the 10-year. At 1.10%, 110%. It is hovering at the highest yield since 2011. And if you're looking at France, they have issuance issues. Their yields are moving up as well. All of this is almost the perfect storm at a time where global growth is questionable. And we can all say how great the US economy is. There's no doubt. We're much better than all the competition. But we overspent much bigger than the competition. And a lot of that money is still slashing around. Much of it's been legislated, but it hasn't necessarily been dispersed entirely yet. Maybe the next administration is going to put the compassion on it. But as things sit now, we are really at a crossroads with respect to interest rates and their effects on everything. Is there going to be enough buyers for all the issuance? I don't know the answer to that. Many believe paying attention to individual auctions is a mug game. I say one of these auctions, whether it's in this country, whether it's in the UK, whether it's in Japan, is going to start to get a little more messy. And things are going to move in unison just the way they are starting to move right now. Kelly, back to you. I thought Dave Zervos reg made an interesting point yesterday about the balance sheet because he's thought that's a big reason why higher rates haven't had more effect. But even he thinks that's going to kind of sunset. We get to the middle of next year and it's going to be back to something more like historical norms, about 20% of the economy. One reason why he thinks actually monetary policy will have more of an impact. High rates might actually be a little bit more felt, a little bit more impact on the economy. Yeah, I think that the Fed and central banks across the globe are not going to have a very happy 2025. Because in my opinion, no matter what they do, it's important. We all need to pay attention. It's going to jangle the curve. Most likely continue to make it steep. But at the end of the day, what's going on in the long end is going to be the star of 2025. Just consider the two's 10 spread just crossed over 30 basis points. Why that's why this has been in over two and a half years. Rick, thank you. Appreciate it. Rick Santelli. Well, the broader market is trying to close out with some nice gains here. The same cannot be said for small caps. The Russell 2000 is closing out with its worst month and about two years. It's down 8% in December. And that leaves it up only 8% this year. That compares with a 25% climb for the S&P 500. But my next guest says that's about to change. Small caps outperform large caps and the six months after a half point rate cut in the third year of a new bull market. And in the first year of a new presidential cycle, Nancy Pryl is here. Coast CEO and senior portfolio manager at S6 Investment Management. Nancy, but you know as well as I do that, you know, passes often not prologue. Yeah. Oh, that's very true. And these of course are just correlations. They're not causations or historical facts. And there is no certainty that they will continue. Having said that, we have seen modest, but still an outperformance for the past six months of the smaller cap segments. More fundamentally, what we're starting to see is a spreading of the growth opportunities in some of the smaller cap beneficiaries of many of the economic trends that have been driving those large cap, particularly the MAG-7 stocks. So if you look at say, for example, AI or infrastructure spending, where that might have been much more concentrated, at least in what we've seen in terms of earnings growth over the past six to 12 months, we're starting to see many more beneficiaries of that spend, meaning the software companies, the services companies that are making use of that AI that are now seeing accelerated revenue and earnings growth. And we think that is the factor that will make the necessary valuation that we've had that will be the factor that makes it both necessary and sufficient to get a reversal of this really 10-year trend of small caps under performing larger caps. Yeah, I'm at the point where I'm taking them out of my diversification model. You know, whatever it is, the 401K or the 512, I don't want the small caps. I don't want them. What are they going to do for me at this point? It's like the international. Get rid of the international. Get rid of the small caps. It's all gone. I'm S&P all the way. I'm you're right. And a lot of people do feel that way. And even as a small cap investor, some days it's frustrating. Having said that, we know that all markets are cyclical. We know that nothing goes up forever. And so when we get to that point of such incredible pessimism, with the percentage of stocks in the small cap universe down to 4% of the investible universe, a historic low, the last time it was this low was back in the 30s. That is a period when you don't want to take that out of your allocation. You actually want to add to that in your allocation. Because if you find those companies that can outgrow, and I'm not saying to buy a passive index in small caps, I think small caps is an area where you need active management. Because as we all know, there's a lot of junk in small caps. There are a lot of non-erners. But we find those companies with those tailwinds economically, the balance sheets and the profit margins to support their growth. That's how you can outperform in this environment. And you have several in mind. And one of them, Amberella, I was like, oh yeah, Amberella. We used to talk about Amberella all the time. It's believed something in the chip space. Pegasystems, Arcosa, AVE point, AVE point, tell me about these. So three of these are plays on AI, and the Internet of Things, if you will. So Pegasystems is a software company that is focused on automation, focused very much on that customer relationship management part of the business, think in terms of agentic AI for Salesforce management, Salesforce productivity. They are a user of AI, as opposed to, and then selling the AI for their customers to use, growing very nicely, beaten, raised quarters, approaching the rule of 40, profitable, all of the things that investors are looking for. It started to be discovered, but we don't believe it's fully discovered. And they have some great new products that they've come out within the last year. Similarly, AVE point, AVE point, AVE point, AVE point, AVE point, AVE point, AVE point, is also a player in this space. They're focused more on the data governments and data management side of the business. So when you think about all of this big data, all the data out there, both AI, as well as all the other applications, you really need data governance and management. AVE point, partners with Microsoft's co-pilot, and again, beaten, raised, nice profitability will be a rule of 40 company. Our COSA is a little bit different. They are an infrastructure play. So they're infrastructure in terms of the power grid, but they're also infrastructure roads, bridges, LNG plants, barges where we're seeing a replacement cycle because of barges and other tank cars are very old. This is the reshore of manufacturing in the United States. It's the bipartisan infrastructure law. And we think it plays incredibly well with some of the things President Trump is going to want to do. Finally, Amber Ralla, yes, semiconductor company, machine vision, robotics. Yeah, and I don't know that I need to say more than that. No, you people are already buying it. No, I'm kidding. But if we look across these four names, it's a good example. At least in this case with active management, two of these names have doubled this year. The other two are about 20%. That's not too shabby for index. It's only up eight, you know? Nancy, appreciate you joining us to talk about some ways to play an area that's been very controversial. Have a great week. Have a great week. Nancy Pryel of ethics. Let's turn to a big tech story now. It's not the sell off. Open AI is officially laying out its plans to change the company's corporate structure. Kate Rudy is back with the details for today's tech check. Let's hear it. Yeah, Kelly. Great to see you. So this transition that's been playing out, it's been anything but smooth for Open AI. And it does highlight an increasingly competitive landscape compared to when this company was founded about a decade ago. It is the first time Open AI has laid out these plans. Its for-profit arm is going to become what's known as a public benefit corporation of PBC. Essentially, it's the same as any for-profit business. But it has this dual mandate. So a fiduciary duty on one side. And then a publicly stated mission. Ben and Jerry's, Patagonia are some of the well-known examples. Plus, names like XAI and Anthropic. Open AI, acknowledging the cash crunch that's behind this decision saying, we once again need to raise more capital than we'd imagined. And that in part, investors need conventional equity and less structural bespoke-ness. That structure has been a headache at times for Open AI. It was on display when CEO Sam Altman was ousted by the non-profit board about a year ago. It can also be confusing. It involves a cat-profit company controlled by the non-profit, which will still exist. And this structure, as you can imagine, not something that investors love those I'm talking to. They're relieved that this is in the works. They really want a pure play for profit. It also makes it easier for Open AI to go public at some point. And then competition. I mentioned that it's really on display here. Musk's XAI is among those competing at this point. Musk is also an Open AI co-founder, started rival. XAI and is suing to block this whole for-profit pivot Open AI fighting back in court. But certainly a headwind here and definitely friends to delay this whole plan. Kelly. The whole ambition for them to go public or have any kind of future as a company, a corporate company, this relies on them being able to make this transition, which some legal experts and non-profit experts have questioned could literally, could they even really pull it off? So this is their attempt to try to. Yeah, they're going to need to do that. They are deeply unprofitable. We should still say losing from what I'm told about $5 billion a year is still at this point. So I think the IPO plan is still a ways down the road. But they've got to get the house in order. They've got to figure this out. Not only if they want to go public, but if they want to keep raising money from folks like Softbank, from some of the big venture capital investors who want their financial interest to be aligned with the board, they don't want the control of the board to be through a non-profit. And that's one of the things where they laid out their reasoning in sort of this blog post. They did say we need the incentives to be aligned with some of the big time investors you can imagine. It's not going to be appealing as a non-profit. It really hasn't been. No, and even if they pull this off, you know, down the road when regulators are coming after all the AI monopolies or whatever, and they're looking at open AI, they're going to go back and say, well, wait a minute, why were you originally a non-profit? Oh, you were doing research. Oh, so you're scraping text off the internet as a research firm, then you change to become a for-profit and capitalized. So I really think it's until kind of like the equivalent of Congress understands the whole story that's taken place here. There's going to be a lot more still to come and come at this company for how exactly they did what they did. For all the benefit that they've given to the world, it was kind of a shady way to do so. It's been interesting to hear Sam Altman justify that decision. And I think the way that he's described it as that they sort of didn't know how much money that this was going to take. They sort of started as a deep tech research lab. That's been the justification that we were a non-profit and that was the way we were going. We didn't realize this whole mission that they have is going to take, you know, maybe $100 billion, $100 billion at this point. And so that's been in the way that they've described it. I would say there's not a lot of trust in that from certain folks in Silicon Valley, Elon Musk, very publicly has challenged that. And the knock on musks argument has been, he now has invested interest in a competitor. So that's been their legal argument. Our open eyes pushed back and said, well, yeah, we know what you think, but also is there a reason you're doing this? Oh, maybe it's because you have one of the biggest competitors. So it's been interesting to hear the two different narratives, but I think you're right. There's a lot to look back at just in 10 years in terms of paper trail and some of the decision making. Yeah, and we'll continue to see if they can do it elegantly successfully and kind of play Kate all those different stakeholders. Kate, thanks. As always, thanks, everybody. Coming up, Bitcoin is down nearly 11 percent now from its record high of about 108,000 less than two weeks ago. Just above 94 today, we're going to look at what to expect from crypto, the exchanges and FinTech next year. Plus another 2024 IPO seeing big gains since its debut service Titan is of 51 percent since going public on the NASDAQ just a couple of weeks ago. One industry watcher says the IPO window is opening back up. Oh, and there's a strong list of candidates waiting their turn. We'll dive into who's next in line when the exchange returns. This is the exchange on CNBC. Get a head start on 2025 with CNBC's big January, the hottest tech event, CES from Las Vegas, the data, the jobs report, and meet the future of biotech and pharma at JPM HealthCare. Check out the MX Golf Tournament from California, inauguration day, and the meeting of world leaders in Davos. Plus the first Fed decision of the year, the investing edge you need to start the year ahead of the game CNBC. Welcome back to the exchange. Bitcoin prices hit an all time high. Remember, it was just over 108,000 on December 17th. But since then, do we call it a correction? It's down 11 percent. It's dragged down the likes of Coinbase and Robert Hood also. And there could be more pain ahead, at least for one of them, according to my next guest, who sees increased competition in 2025 with more crypto exchanges entering the market. Dan Dulliv is back. He's senior FinTech analyst and managing director at Mazew. The Coinbase people are throwing eggs at the screen, Dan. They're like, come on, we did fine at the end of the year. What's the problem? I know, I know. And it's been a bad call, right? So sometimes, I had bad calls, I had some good calls. It's been a bad call on Coinbase and kudos to them. But I still think that if you're going to bet on crypto, your bet or bet is Robin Hood. Right? I'm not a fan of crypto, as you know. But if you're going to bet on it, your bet or bet is Robin Hood. And that's because of the diversification of the revenue stream. And so I still stand by my call that Coinbase's fees are too high. And eventually, more competition is going to drag them down. And just the difference in fees is just mind-boggling. One further point on this that we talk to the Coinbase bowls that they make, especially talking about why the stock was just so strong in the past month or two kind of post-election. It's because of, it's not just Bitcoin, it's all the coins, right? So whatever goofy, and not goofy. Some of them are real protocols and some of them are goofy or coins. But the idea is a lot of that activity. I don't know if you have the numbers is happening on that platform. And that's a good point, right? They do make more money off of these, let's call them altcoin. There's maybe not so much, you know, not the words very nice to say to call them altcoins. But we'll stick with that. I do want to say that right now, I went to the Robin Hood analyst day, and they said that Coinbase is listing over 200 tokens, right? And Robin Hood about 20, they've been much more conservative. But Robin Hood is growing the number of tokens. So even on that sort of apples to apples comparison over the next year or two, you're going to get a lot more tokens traded on Robin Hood than today. So it's been true in the past. It might not be true in the future. Which other or which other exchanges are coming into play here and adding to the competition? So I mean, I've seen there's been some reports about crypto.com meeting with Trump, etc. I mean, I see the same news that you're seeing. But I think that just the let's call this the administration embracing crypto, which has kind of been that the thing everyone is saying. It's definitely going to drive more exchanges to go public, more exchanges to like increase their presence in the US because it's become easier to offer crypto token trading in the US. I appreciate that you assume that I'm following all of this news. But I need you to kind of draw my attention to those to those points where, you know, you see real change happening. So that brings, let's talk a little bit about Robin Hood. You think it's better set up. I believe they recently announced they're getting into sports betting. They do obviously all sorts of different financial products that are trying to get more retirement accounts on the platform. And you like that model versus the crypto pure play. Yeah, because they'll be, I mean, a the breath, right? They're going global. They're eyeing a $600 billion 10 globally. They just opened an office in Singapore this year. And so if you know about sort of, I think about 70, I think it was like 70% of Bitcoin trading volumes is in Asia. I mean, I've seen some statistic around it. So definitely a huge 10 out there. So I think that the better bet here on Robin Hood is a, the fees are lower. And B, if the day comes and I'm right and maybe crypto trading isn't as exciting as people think it is, there's much more, you know, there's equities. There's to your point retirement, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So this is more being conservative and being diversified versus putting all your chips on, you know, crypto trading, which is what Coinbase is all about today. Two final and unrelated questions. You kind of kind of take this as you'd like. I'm curious for an update on SoFi, which I believe you're quite bullish on last year. Also kind of the, the by now pay later platforms. What's the outlook there for 2025? Yeah, so let's start with SoFi. I mean, I have been wrong on Coinbase. We've had some great calls this year. One of them was so fine. I think that it's actually, I keep taking, I kept taking up my price target and it kept reaching my price target. I've seen some analysis, but I think it was Josh Brown said, like people are saying that financials have gone up too much. But if you look at it in history, historical perspective, it really hasn't moved that much. So there's way more upset. Let me give you the catalyst here. One, they're now doing lending as a platform. So that basically allows them to do more lending with absolutely no risk on the balance sheet. And be all these things like student loans, mortgage. They've opened dormant for the last two years since rates have come up. All these are going to open up in 25. And I see much more upside for SoFi. And then to your point on by now pay later, I've done some analysis that looks at comparison of, you know, a firm versus, versus Clarna. And I'm not saying anything about Clarna. But when you look at the numbers, you look at a firm being, you know, having like three, four times higher take rate, two times more profitable. Their business model is just so strong and so rigid and other getting into Europe. I think more IPOs in the binocular space are going to shine a very positive light on a firm. That's really interesting because obviously Clarna has filed for that. Something maybe it'll happen sometime next year. And we will be looking more into the economics, you know, any of the regulatory pressures and so forth. Dan, I'm trying to figure out where you are that it's dark outside. I'm in Tokyo. I got in with the family today. Nothing to do with work. Nothing to do with me do. Oh, I love me do. But, um, but, uh, you know, it's great here and make it every blast. Isn't it suit? Can you really? You know what? It's actually really, really cheap. Yeah. When you come for, especially when you come from New York, it's really cheap. And by the way, the tip is included. It makes it even cheaper. I'm not going, but your, your family is lucky. That they can go with you. And Dan, thanks for taking the time out of your trip for us. You really appreciate it. Dan Dullab with Mizuho. Coming up, the NASDAQ 100 is on pace for its worst day since the 18th with only seven components in the green. Tesla is the worst performer out of the bunch, down 5%, while biogen and American electric power are vying for the top spot, but up just fractionally. More of the big movers when the exchange returns. It's CNBC's big January with CES from Las Vegas, Viotech and Farma at JPM Healthcare, the World Economic Forum in Davos, and the first Fed decision of the year. Start the year ahead of the game. CNBC. Welcome back to the exchange. I'm Kate Rooney with your CNBC News Update. NATO said today it's boosting its presence in the Baltic Sea after this suspected sabotage this week of an undersea cable. It comes as the Finnish police boarded a Russian oil tanker on Thursday to investigate whether it damaged the cable, which carries electricity between Finland and Estonia. This is the latest disruption to the undersea cables that is being investigated as an act of sabotage. Meanwhile, the CDC said a genetic analysis of the bird flu virus in the patient in Louisiana shows mutations that would make it easier to spread to humans, but there was no evidence the virus was passed to others. The CDC said earlier this month, the patient was likely infected from contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock. And in Mexico, the government is testing a new cell phone app that will allow migrants to send an alert if they believe they're about to be detained by US immigration officials to warn their relatives and the nearest Mexican consulate. It comes as in anticipation, rather, President-elect Trump clamping down an immigration when he takes office in January, Kelly, back over to you. All right. Hey, thank you very much. Still ahead, here's another look at our mystery chart. It's a popular home appliance, but I think someone already guessed it. The shares are down about 6% this year. Keep sending them in. We have a little bit more time still. Before we reveal that name, Reddit, Astara Labs, and Waystar are some of 2024's biggest IPOs finishing the year pretty strong. Reddit of 23% Astara 38. This month, Pitchbox sees 10 high-profile companies with a greater than 90% chance of going public next year. It's 2025. Finally, the year the IPO pipeline opens. That's next on the Exchange. Welcome back to the Exchange. Names like Microsoft, Alphabet, and NVIDIA are all down about 2% today with a big tech sell-off. Of course, they've had Monster Runs a year to date. Big part of that is AI. Public companies weren't the only ones funneling big bucks into the technology, either. AI captured more than a quarter of all the venture dollars in Q3. And while deal-making and public debuts have been slow this year, my next guest thinks they will pick up in 2025. Duncan Davidson is back with us. He's a partner at Bullpen Capital. I feel like you're often more of a, what do we say, Duncan? Like you poo-poo. So the fact that you're more ra- ra on the IPO pipeline makes me hopeful. I think it might be chime. I know Stripes also filed in a few others, but chime is a wonderful company. You're probably a $25 billion value. I would look for them to get out quickly. Another one is Cerebris, which is AI chip company. And we all love AI chip companies. And they have a new idea. And so I hope they get out. They're doing a complete wafer functioning chip system on the chip, so to speak, which is a difficult thing to do. If they get that done, they'll be a hell of an offering. I'd like to see them all come out. Why do you think, and I go back to, who was at Databricks, who did that $10 billion private raise? I mean, and others who are trying to find ways to give liquidity to employees. Why not just go public? The market was, I don't understand how it could not have been receptive this year. The S&P was up 30%. People were hungry for tech. All the IPO's did pretty well. Like, what is everyone waiting for? You have to accept that the US government and its wisdom after 2000.com bubble really screwed up the IPO business. It just made it expensive and difficult and not at all what it used to be. And it hasn't gotten any better. And that no change has been made. In fact, there's new regulations that keep on getting thrown at this whole system, ecosystem. So I do think having a deregulatory oriented SEC or government and FTC is going to help people want to go public and not to suffer. Because what's happened is they've come up with alternative ways to take the benefit of being public without being public. They found ways to get liquidity to employees with stock options without being a public company. So, you know, market always finds a way around all the rocks and obstacles. So if you get some rid of some of them, we can go public again. And I didn't mean to cut you off. Who else? Because I like how the list you were starting to give us. Who else do you think is going to be candidates to emerge into the public eye next year? Well, Stripe is one of Brisbane waiting for. That would be huge. Stubhub's another. And there's a company called Clarna, which our venture fund is a small interest in, very small, that might get out as well. Those are some of them. You can see a theme here, a lot of fintech, as opposed to SaaS, which I think makes sense for opening up this market. Are you bearish on SaaS? No, it's just that the SaaS multiples, even though they've come up with it, are not very good. So why take your company out when the multiples aren't going to be exciting? So you're looking for markets. A fintech also had a big push down in multiples, but it's coming back. So that's what the VCs look for. They don't want to take the company out prematurely with a bad multiple. That's way till the market is early receptive to the category. All right. Duncan saying service Titan was the biggie. What a great story, too. You know, they're guys who are working with their dads in construction and then they start the software business and great reception. I guess that's SaaS. Now, while I say this too about service Titan, it's losing money. It's very promising when a tech IPO is losing money and gets a really good reception in the public market. That's a good, a good thing. Oh, we're back to normal. We hope so. We've won. We're back to normal. Happy New Year. Let's all hope you're doing. You too. Yes, great to check in with you as always. Hopefully you'll be busier and see more of you next year for the IPO window. Duncan Davidson. Love it. Thank you. Let's stick with the private market and what it can tell us about the state of clean tech at no one's talking about clean tech and the IPOs may as Pippa Stevens is here with that story, though. Pippa, do tell. Yes, if you look at stock performance alone, you might think that investors have lost all interest in clean energy. But in private markets, there's actually still, it is attracting billions of dollars. Climate-focused funds have raised $47 billion this year. That's up 20 percent from last year and just below 2022's record level, according to data from Sightline Climate. With much of that driven by infrastructure funds, that said deployment has slowed. There's now $86 billion in dry powder as investors become more selective on what they're backing. Additionally, while there's capital available at the earliest and latest stages, the missing middle or the capital required to help companies scale that aren't ready to be public remains absent in what Sightline Climate says is leaving a critical funding void in the climate tech innovation ecosystem, particularly for scaling breakthrough technologies. Now, Mike Collier from Weaver told me that large public energy companies are one source that could fill the gap, given broad investment portfolios and deep technological know-how. And they're already playing a big role with corporate VC representing about a third of clean tech funding. So the bottom line here is that money is still there, but no one's chasing unicorns and people are being a lot more selective. You said something really interesting to me the other day, which is that we could actually see an LNG company in the IPO pipeline next year? Yep, that's great. So venture global filed, though, S1, a couple weeks ago at this point, we don't yet have any indication on how much they're looking to raise, but they are already exporting. They have one facility, Calcashou in Louisiana. That's one makes sure I have the name right. Calcashou. They all have their own name. So they have Calcashou in Louisiana, and then they're also working on placomins, which is also down in Louisiana. And so that one could come online starting next year, not reaching full production quite yet, but so they are certainly a name to watch. And with all of this potential demand backing LNG, particularly when we look to Europe and what they're importing as well as China, Japan, South Korea, all these countries are banking on US gas. And so that could be one to watch next year. Listen, we've been getting into the weeds, but whether it's SASS versus FinTech companies, how about some energy names? I mean, that would be something not on many people's prediction cards, I think. But Pipa, thanks. As always, we appreciate it. Pipa Stevens. 2024 was a good year for retail. Well, I mean, the XRT is up 12%. I don't know. That's trailing. This is about half the performance of the broader market. I mean, it's not terrible, but Walmart, Kelanova, Costco, and Croger, they had a blowout year. Our analyst says that while value-oriented retailers were hot, big ticket spending could be the story for 2025. Her picks for the new year are coming up after this. Cheers. Cheers. Costco is under pressure today after the FDA raised its alert level on an egg recall there. New York-based farm had voluntarily recalled nearly 11,000 units of organic pasture raised eggs sold under Costco's Kirkland signature brand. That was on November 27 due to Salmonella concerns. No illnesses reported at the time. The FDA updating its recall classification today, though, saying there's a reasonable probability that using the eggs could cause illness or death. NBC News reached out to the FDA with questions about cases but has not received a response. Costco shares it down nearly 4% since that recall was announced last month or back right after this. Welcome back to the Exchange. Let's get one last look at our mystery chart today. If you guessed Whirlpool, Tom Brune, you were right again. Shares are down 5% for the year, but my next guest names a top pick for 2025 Whirlpool. She's been on big ticket, home-related spending, to be a hit in the new year. And also likes Mohawk and Tempr Seely. For more, let's bring in Laura Champagne. She's director of research and senior consumer analyst at Loop Capital. You threw me for a loop, Laura, with the Whirlpool pick. Welcome. The thanks, Kelly. Thanks for having me. So the reason I say that is because Whirlpool seems to be the kind of company that every time it turns around something else happens. Washing machines, appliances have been, I think this started with the Obama administration doing tariffs. Now here we are. They have to compete in the global markets. Yeah, we, so again, why do you think this is now a stock that's poised to shine? Sure. To address your confusion, we mentioned in our initiation report earlier this year that this stock has never been a great stock over a long period of time. But if you catch the cycle right, the moves can be really powerful. And they're operating now after two years of decline, similar to 08 and 09 and appliance units. They're operating at 75% of capacity in their plants, which are largely domestic and vertically domestic, meaning you won't really see supply chain issues with components. So next year, interest rates have come down. Perhaps not as fast as some of us have hoped for. And maybe there'll be fewer cuts next year. But typically in a cycle that's that's that we're seeing interest rates falling, demand in these categories improves. And this is a company with spring loaded earnings power. Also during this downturn, they sold their European businesses, which we're never really going to earn their cost of capital. So thrilled to see them out of that mess and really focusing on their domestic market where they have about 30% plus market share. All three of those companies, Mohawk, Tempor, Whirlpool, about 30% market share in their industry. So very well positioned to whether any issues with demand and very well positioned to benefit as demand comes back. You know, and I'm sure you're getting all these questions that we get a lot of the same about, okay, where are some places that I can kind of invest with, Americans, supply chains and so forth. So I don't actually know, does Whirlpool manufacture domestically? Almost all their manufacturing is domestic. So you'll see them also producing components close to where their factories are based. So it's a company with a lot of facilities in Ohio, some manufacturing in the south. But still they also on KitchenAid, which makes all those great stand mixers in unionized plants in the Midwest. So a domestic manufacturer that should benefit from tariffs and they've been in a big disadvantage buying steel from domestic manufacturers, whereas their competitors, some of the Korean competitors have been buying half-price steel from China over the last few years. Fascinating. You know, I could never figure out why the KitchenAid stand mixer is so expensive and so heavy. I'm like, the handheld blender is like a five dollar thing. Why is putting it on a stand suddenly make it $250 and it weighs like so much that I can't even lift it off myself? Right. I mean, I think that they've kind of earned that. I mean, they've had plenty of competition for decades now, but I think the durability of that product and you can see the labor that's in it and also just the strong components that they've got in those models. Yeah. You see, all businesses where they didn't have as much of a quality advantage, you know, they used to own Hoover, which was a massive brand. You really won't see that anymore. So they've divested things that have not been viable. They're left owning a really good package of brands, we think. And if you do see a recovery not looking for a V-shaped recovery, but just GDP growth in these categories, you would see 20% plus EPS growth next year. What do you expect for the housing market broadly? We would expect a recovery starting in them.
