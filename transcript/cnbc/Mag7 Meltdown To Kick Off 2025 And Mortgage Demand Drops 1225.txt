Indeed it does live from the Nasdaq market site in the heart of New York City's Times Square. This is fast money and here's what's on tap tonight. Holiday hanging over stocks stumbling out of the gate to start the new year after limping to the finish line. In 2024 is this a bad setup for a bull run this year will debate that plus stuck in reverse shares of Tesla taking it on the front bumper after reporting their first ever drop in annual deliveries. We will break down the stocks recent slide coming up and later the builders bruised and battered will the slide continue in 2025 energy on the climb to this rebound be for real and a call of the day on over. Why Goldman is so bullish? Welcome everybody I'm Tyler Matheson in from Melissa Lee coming to you live from studio Beath and Nasdaq market site on the desk tonight. Bono and I see Karen Feinerman, Courtney Garcia and Guy Adami. Folks welcome everybody happy new year. We start with a magnificent 7 meltdown led by losses in apple. The iPhone maker dropping more than 2.5% today biggest loss by the way since October and shedding 100 billion dollars in the market. The stock has now dropped more than 6% from the all time high it hit just a week ago back when we were counting the ticks to the $4 trillion market gap mark it closed at less than $3.7 trillion that's not so bad when you really think about it. Apple's weakness dragging down the broader market on this first trading day of 2025 major indexes all down though off their winters. The stock has now dropped more than 6% from the all time high it hit just a week ago back when we were counting the total of the market. We are going to go down though off their worst levels of the day. Fractional declines really in percentage terms for the big three. S&P touching its lowest level by the way since election day. So does this sort of choppy start to 2025. Portend and end of a two year mega rally what do you say Karen? I hope not. First of all it's so good to have a good time. I think that's a good time to have a good time. And Neil Caluto just wasn't available. That's sent off a week or two ago whenever it was really not a dry eye and easy. Anyway we're lucky to have you. What were we talking about? We were talking about Apple and the magnificent seven. What do we think about the market for this year? I think it's the best of the year I think. But I like the ones that I own Apple. I think on this desk we haven't loved Apple primarily because of price. The sort of the disappointment about AI and whether the you know the I don't know when we're really going to see phone sales take off because people love the Apple AI experience. I don't want to take a bite of Apple. I'll take a bite. I'll see if I can chew this one down. I think a courty and I were on the show and the other two panelists. We hate that word. We're a family here. But the other two members. I think collectively we've said listen, there are times where Apple is a legitimate trading vehicle. It oscillates. There's times to get in. If you've been long that same volatility makes it very tough for you to time and you're not going to be a long time. It's a very, very, very, very, it's one that you should own and hold on to. Now for those of us that have said on the sidelines, I'll be the first to raise my hand. I just don't understand what the real drivers of the super cycle are. And if AI is the catalyst behind it, I can understand that they don't have the same cash spend as some of the other mag seven. And for me, pe expansion, I don't think AI is a story yet or I don't see it. For Apple, you're saying Apple specifically. And they're having competitive issues in China, right? Where they've had to lower their prices to compete with Huawei and other, by the way, I was in Europe last summer and I saw some of the Huawei phones. They are cool looking. Did you grab one? I love them. I like that phone. But anyway, so they've got issues there and the latest phone is selling in the U.S. and whether it's going to like the phone. Yeah, I mean, headline risk without question. It is great to have your towel. And your legend will only grow in retirement. But I'll say this, you know, if you think about the things that I got wrong last year and clear there were many, but passive investing, you don't realize the magnitude and so you start to see the numbers. And a trillion dollars made their way into ETFs and mutual funds last year, which was a record. Apple wins to this. There aren't 487 ETFs, 410 of which, Apple's one of the top 15, 1 5 holdings. So as long as money flows in, Apple will almost by definition go higher. But that doesn't mean valuation makes any sense. And, you know, Bona will just spoke to that. I mean, you talk about a company that was a growth company nine, ten years ago. It was trading at a ridiculously cheap valuation. It was trading in the low teens. Now that it's become sort of a value stock, it's trading north of 30 times next year's numbers. With EPS growth, maybe a 12%, 8% revenue growth. It doesn't make a lot of sense. So they win in this environment. But be careful if it flips. And that's one of my biggest concerns of 25. Let's broaden out here, Courtney, a little bit. And pick up on one of the things Bona once said there about AI. Last year, I think, it would be hard to argue that one of the main drivers of the market was the AI lift that was in there. Absolutely. Are you expecting that kind of lift to re-occur this year? And if it doesn't, what kinds of stocks are going to move ahead? What will the drivers be? And I think there's a lot of structural changes with artificial intelligence that are going to continue. So I think some of your easy money in AI has probably been made. I don't know if you're going to see something like an Nvidia. I'll perform to the same magnitude that it has been. A lot of that magnitude has already been priced in. But then look at energy, for example. Like there's not enough energy to go around for these AI data centers for electric vehicles. So I think there's a lot of these stories that are surrounding AI that aren't going to be able to do this. So I think there's a lot of things that are going to be around the AI that aren't going away any time here in the near future. So yeah, like with Apple, it's like an AI emoji going to make me get the new iPhone, probably not. But do we need that energy to create all the new AI stories? Absolutely. So is that kind of a two cheers for energy here? Is that, is that one here? Absolutely. Anybody else want to pick up on energy? Well, it makes sense. I mean, we didn't talk about this stock for the first 16, 17 years of the show. And it's VST, Vista Energy. And quite frankly, there's no reason to talk about it. I mean, I didn't do anything. Look at the performance that had last year on the back of exactly what Courtney is just talking about. I mean, this is a stock that's been reinvigorated by this whole AI phenomenon. And yeah, it's probably extended on valuation. But those are the names that are going to win in 2025. And I'll say this quickly, Semis topped out in July. You say what you want, but look at an SMH chart. That's when it all topped out. And they've been sideways to lower ever since. Outside of maybe Broadcom and maybe of Marvel. AMD's been awful. You throw a micron into Mix Qualcomm. Even in video since their earnings release has not traded well, that's something to watch early this year as well. Thoughts here, Karen? So, for AI, I mean, to me, we look at MagSever and how much is driven by AI, Meta has been the most compelling story because they've been the most able to translate that spend, which is enormous, into actually giving advertisers what they want. They're able to target ads. The ads are more effective. The advertisers will pay more for them. And so, to me, Zuckerberg deserves the benefit of the doubt here on this gigantic spend. We've seen him spend before and it didn't work out with the Metaverse. But I think it's, it's, it had a great year, it had a great two years, but it's still pretty compelling it, a mid for mid 20-ish multiple, not in cloud excluding the cash. So it's a little more than a market multiple for I think a stock that is way better than an average market stock. One one is you look at the at the landscape of 2025. Is this a year where the market, it goes back sort of to what God was saying, semiconductor sort of topped out there in the middle of last year, including, including Nvidia. Is this a year where the market broadens away from the MagSever and some sectors like energy, like financials and so forth, move ahead? I think there will be a significant pick up in volatility in 2025. And you know, I believe that most investors, particularly our audience, should have some passives. But I think 2025 will give you an opportunity to be a much more agile and active trader. So I think for now, you see, you see an energy or pockets of it, you know, some of Vistra, consolation energy, some of those were leaders today for solar. I think you'll get opportunities where there will be ebbs and flows of money flows in and out of those subsectors. But I have a hard time thinking that we will get multiple expansion without that MagSever lift. Especially with rates going higher. You know, I'm probably one of the few people to think I still think 10 new yields are going to 5%. Throw up a TLT chart and I think it's going to trade down to the levels that we saw in October of last year. There's about 82 and a half or so, which sort of equates to about 4, 9 or so in the 10-year yield. I don't think the market's prepared for that at all. In valuations, certainly, don't support that. So higher interest rates to me is one other thing you got to focus on, especially with all the issuances coming out over the first couple months of this year. I think that's a really good point. I think there are two things that make this year different this year that we're looking at head toward. Number one is what happens with the magnificent 7 and the AI lift that may not be there to the same degree. And the other thing is that rising interest rates this year and how the market and how you're going to have to discount against that. Let's move on. Our next guest, Expect Stocks, to rebound this year to new all-time highs. Chris Harvey is the head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. Chris, welcome. Good to have you here. You say this is going to be a good year, but a bad vintage. What do you mean by that? So I think equities are going to go up this year, but people are going to put on too much risk. So for the last couple of years, people have been playing momentum. I buy strength. I sell weakness. That's comparable to I keep pushing my bets. I keep pushing my bets into the table. That's fine, but it builds up risk over time. The other thing is people are going to start to go out on the risk, too far out on the risk curve and too far down the capital structure. Because the person to the right, the person to the left is going to make more money and there's going to be a bit of fomal. So this is a year that I think equities do go higher, whether it's related to a good economy, the fence still cutting rates, emitting activity, IPOs. But when we look back from the purchase 27, we're going to say 25 was a year where people put on too much portfolio. Are you with Bonoan that this is going to be a year of heightened volatility or more volatility than we've had? I think that's an easy yet. Yes, we didn't have much volatility last year. We had a spike in the beginning of, what was it, August? And that just disappeared after that. Credit spreads are still incredibly tight. We should see some spikes in volatility or a lot more spikes in volatility. How do I play that? What do I do? What do you do? What we do is we've been barbelling some of the things that we really like. We like the communication space. We like banks. But we want to barbell that versus staples. Staples unloved, underappreciated. And that's going to give you a portfolio of some balance. And at times when the market really trades off, that's going to help out the poor followers. So you really want to barbell something defensive with something you like, garbily, something a little bit more cyclical. So when you're talking about investors being more levered, are you saying they themselves are more levered or they're looking at things that are more levered, which the max seven is not? So what I think is they're going to put on more portfolio leverage. The other thing that we're going to see is more M&A activity, which will bring leverage into the system. Furthermore, when you look at credit spreads being this tight, you and I could go out and issue 200 million, I'm exaggerating, but you could issue a lot of paper. And so more leverage is going to come into the marketplace that way as well. So you're seeing on a portfolio level, you're seeing on a corporate level. And I think you're going to see a lot more risk seeking as a year goes on. What do you see to guys point a moment ago, interest rates moving up. He thinks they're going to go up. What did you say toward least five percent? And what does that do to the overall? And your price target is one of the highest on the street. Seven thousand seven. Seven double seven. Seven double seven. Big things, bond fans. Yeah, dry, straight up. So what that does is that that's not positive, but we do think that rates do peak in the first quarter. Bonds are actually a pretty good risk reward at this point time. The compensation you're getting on bonds above inflation expectations. It's about two and a quarter percent. You haven't seen that for a sustained period of time since 06, excuse me, 06 right when the Fed was still raising rates, not easing rates. So yes, we can get rates go higher. I don't think you can sustain 5% for a long period of time. And I do think that rates will come down because the economy I think will slow down in the second half of the year. Communication services is one of the elements of your barbell approach here. What are those companies? Which one? That's your meta is your Google's, your Netflix, some of your 18T Verizon and some of the cable companies. Yeah, and so you think those are well positioned and financials. Big bang of it. Financials is a big, big space. What are you emphasizing there? I think Karen hit on the head before. With communication, it's that quintessential, garpy space. Yes, the stocks have done really well for the last two years, but valuation is still attractive. They're still able to commercialize and they're one of the first ones to really be able to commercialize AI. And so the underlying fundamentals are still really strong. Technicals, momentum look really good. With regard to banks, I just think you're going to have upward EPS revisions for banks. And you're still going to have relative multiple expansions for the banking space because of the regulatory environment. If the year ends where you think it is, 7,000, 007, is the first half going to be where the fun is or the second half? I think it's the first half, right? I'm worried if we do get close to that number by September or something, we really want to start de-risking the portfolio at that point in time. I do think we're going to start to see a lot more merger Mondays. I think you're going to see a lot more IPOs. Once you see that, people will have more money to play with. Their risk appetite will go stronger. And again, we're looking at a period where the economy is still strong, credit spreads are tight, the Fed is still easing, maybe not as much as we thought they would, and momentum is still very much in play. That's a pretty good recipe for upward stocks. Chris, did you know that it's in my contract that if I host, you have to be here. It's like every time I'm here, it's up and you are here. And we're glad you are. Thank you so much. Happy New Year, my friend. Happy New Year. All right, this is the portion of the show where we get to agree with Chris or trash him. We would like to start, Courtney. No, and I am also very optimistic on where the markets are going next year. I think a lot of those animal spirits that we saw coming out post-election have been dampened when we saw the pull back in the sale. They actually saw him lately. I think the last month. Correct, which I think actually probably puts you in a little bit of a better position in 2025 when some of that has been let out of the sales. And I think there's still a lot of that opportunity to come because we are still going into a new administration. There is likely going to be less regulation. There's also talks of tax cuts, which we really haven't talked about yet. And I think a lot of those things are going to position the economy to continue to do well next year. So, economy may do well, but that will maybe let's assume it does. Okay. What does that do to the Fed? That takes a little of the interest rate lowering pressure away. I think they've made their path pretty clear. I think the market wants something that the Fed's not going to give them. And I think the bond market is pretty much telling you that. But I'll say this as well. I think today was a glimpse of what you could see for the next few months without question. I mean, the fix of one point today was above 19 and a half. I mean, it closed lower than that. But you saw a glimpses of volatility and what was, yeah, a bit of a volatile day, but not that volatile. So, buckle up. And again, bonds will matter. The semi-trade will matter. And I think Chris would be the first one to say it's not a straight line to 7,000. And it might get there by year end, but it's going to be interesting to see where it heads first. And let's talk about deal actually. That's one of his hypotheses is that more deals this year. Agree? I do. And I like the call on banks there, particularly the large integrated that also have an investment banking arm because the volatility that I'm reporting will see will likely lead to increase in trading revenues as well bolstering. Karen, wrap it up for us. What do you think? Agree. I mean, I like that deal. And also when you see that's great for the banks and I have banks. But also the other players in the sector where one got acquired, it's good for the rest of them. It's sort of breeds excitement. And I think it's going to happen. All right. Let's move on to where a lot of the action is going to be over the next couple of days, certainly and weeks to Washington. Republicans less than 24 hours from taking control of both the House and the Senate. But still a lot of uncertainty over who will be the House Speaker. Our Emily Wilkins has the very latest as the deadline approaches Emily. Hey, Tyler. Well, yeah, Mike Johnson could face a battle for his speakership tomorrow. If all lawmakers are present and they all vote for someone, they would only take two lawmakers to deny Johnson the gavel to Republicans going against him. And we know at least one Republican Congressman Thomas Massey says he's not going to vote for Johnson. He criticized him and linked the ex post for the way that Johnson handled the government shutdown battle last month. Saying that Johnson quote already demonstrated that he won't tell the president what is achievable and what is not achievable in the House. And he lacks the situational awareness himself to know what can pass and what cannot. Now about half a dozen other members are also undecided. Several of them actually met with Johnson this afternoon and leaving that meeting Johnson struck an optimistic tone. People are talking through process change really one and those kinds of things and I'm open to that and I think tomorrow is going to go. So one big difference, of course, between the last Congress and now is that any Republican who wants to block the speaker, they're just delaying progress on their own GOP agenda. That includes, of course, dealing with the debt limit, which as of yesterday is no longer suspended, giving lawmakers now a few months to figure out a solution. Tyler. Emily, let me ask you a sort of technical question about the vote for the speakership. When someone like that representative says I'm not going to vote for Speaker Johnson, does that necessarily mean that he's going to vote against him? In other words, if he voted or others, you do not support Johnson, vote present. Does that create more wiggle room for Speaker Johnson to continue in the seat? I love this wonky question, Tyler. And the short answer is yes. The short answer is that I think you can have up to four members come in, vote present, and Johnson will be just fine. Where it gets tricky is that if members actually start voting for someone else, be it Elon Musk, be it Donald Trump, be it, you could do Mickey Mouse, I think. And that's where you're going to see the kind of breakdown in the votes, because member McCarthy won with four members not voting for him, but voting for no one else in voting for him. I don't think it has ever happened, but you do not have to be a member of the House to be the Speaker of the House, right Emily? You don't, but I will bet anyone to be here that we are probably going to be seeing, probably going to be seeing Mike Johnson as Speaker. I think the question is, how many times does it take him to get there? And what sort of the things does he wind up promising or giving away or negotiating in that process? Because you have a lot of these members who are undecided, their main concern is spending, and they want to make sure that Johnson is going to be addressing it. All right, Emily, thank you very much. Emily Wilkins in Washington for us. Let's take a quick break coming up a rough start to the new year for a few high profile names like Tesla, Boeing, Nike, all in the red today. The reasons behind those moves are next. Plus homebuilder stocks getting hit as new mortgage data filters in. But could there be an opportunity in this space? We're going to grill down on that trade when fast money returns. We're back in tune. You're watching Fast Money. Here on CNBC. We'll be right back. Weekdays at 5 a.m. be first on world markets. First to the global business conversation. Get a jump on the investing day every day with Frank Holland. Success starts early. Worldwide Exchange 5 a.m. Eastern CNBC. Welcome back to Fast Money. Everybody got a news alert now on that US Treasury hack from earlier this week. Megan Kasella has the details. Hi, Megan. Tyler, we're learning just a little bit more about what exactly was accessed in that hack Bloomberg news is now reporting that Chinese hackers were able to hack into the computers of senior US Treasury Department leaders. They say roughly 100 government computers were compromised that they were accessing unclassified material. That's what the Treasury Department had already said that this was all unclassified material. But that it was specifically some senior leaders computers are not saying who exactly but they're saying that hackers were able to access drafts and notes for policy decisions, itineraries and travel planning documents as well as some internal communications that they're still trying to decide, trying to figure out exactly what was taken. But that once again it was all unclassified information. So this does go a little bit further than what we already knew about this hack. It follows the Washington Post reporting that it was the sanctions office specifically as well as the Secretary's office that had been targeted and breached in this hack. So more still to come out on this just today congressional Republicans have been asking for a briefing in the Treasury Department says that they will be briefing Hill Republicans or Hill leaders on this. I should say so that's something to watch next week. More details will be coming out then Tyler. All right, Megan. Thank you very much. Megan Kasella in Washington. Meanwhile, Tesla shares plunging 6% to kick off 2025 after the EV maker reported its first ever drop in annual deliveries year over year worst performing stock in the SMT. 500 today deliveries last year coming in about 1% below 2023 levels at 1.7 9 million versus 1.81. Our fill the bow has the details. Was this expected? Phil? Wasn't a surprise Tyler. If they were going to hit the consensus, they were still going to see a year over a year decline in deliveries. Here's the numbers for the fourth quarter. I mentioned that they did not hit the consensus. The consensus was for 504,000 and 7700 vehicles to be delivered. They delivered just over 5 495,000. As is usually the case, 95% of them model three and model why. So as you take a look at annual deliveries, as you guys pointed out, 1.81 million was what they delivered in 2023. They fall about 20,000 vehicles shy of that for 2024. So really close almost flat, but it's still a decline. The first one really since Tesla, you'd have to go back to their days of making the roadster when they were only delivering a few thousand vehicles. And even then it's hard to determine exactly whether or not they ever had a decline in vehicle deliveries. So this is the first one as they've ramped up production and really hit the commercial markets around the world. If there is a silver lining in the report today, it's with energy storage deployments. They report that every quarter along with their annual deliveries. And it was a nice number that they reported in terms of the fourth quarter deployment, 11 gigawatt hours. Most they have ever done in a quarter. The consensus was for 9.6 gigawatt hours. The 2024 deployments of energy storage up 113% compared to 23. And remember, they've got a megawatt plant that's going to be coming online in China in early 2025. So we expect that probably we'll see even greater energy deployments as you take a look at shares of Tesla. Keep in mind that they will be reporting their Q4 results January 29 after the bell. And the focus is really going to be less about deliveries, although that will get a lot of questions. The focus is going to be about what Elon Musk says about robot taxi development and also take a look at shares of B.Y.D. B.Y.D. said that for the year of 24 Tyler 1.76 million vehicles delivered so Tesla keeps the crown at least for another year as the overall leader in EV sales worldwide. Tyler, I wanted to ask you if you have any granularity on where where were the sales more slow than in other it was China unnotable week spot. Do you know that? Do they break it out that way or was it a slide in the US regions, but we they don't break it up by regions. But you can put the numbers together and you look at things like vehicle registrations. They actually in in the fourth quarter and this third and fourth quarter were increasing deliveries in China, but they're not growing sales as quickly as China's EV market is growing. So that's one area where they're feeling pressure and then here in the United States. You know, they're also going to be facing the questions about what happens with the EV tax credit on a federal level. All right, Phil, both thank you very much. Let's kick it around a little bit. Thoughts on Tesla. I think there's general concern around just the demand for EVs, at least in the interim, which is why you've seen a lot of the heritage, US automakers kind of pull back or either do completely away with or push back what their what their target dates have been. But I really don't want to conflate the two between B.Y.D. and Tesla. They're playing two completely different games, although Tesla has shown some willingness to entertain compressing margins in order to drive up drive up sales and push out competitors. We're not talking about a state backed agency, a state backed enterprise, although that may be what is just joking. There's a joke in there right now. But my point is like I don't think the comparison should necessarily be between the two and then that inform an investor whether or not Tesla is a worthwhile investment. They've just pulled back from that unprecedented presidential, uh, electoral like what it was with a 60% run or 40% run since November 70% run. I mean, exactly. So they've given up about 20, 25% of that. I think you've got to put that in context before saying that, okay, well now Tesla is no longer investable because they missed deliveries by a percent year over year. Well, it's interesting the question has fell. I mean, clear the market wasn't prepared for it on the back of the sell off, right? So maybe people were expecting it, but in terms of market positioning, it wasn't given the move we saw today and given the amount of shares that traded with that said, you know, I'm surprised it's still trading on delivery numbers because now it's about full self driving and robot taxis and all those other things that they've been promising for quite some time. If you're looking for a level, this is it. I mean, this was the prior all time high back in November of 2021. So we basically traded all the way back down to a prior high, which should be support. So if you want to play from the long side, here you go. Alrighty, let's take a quick break. A lot more fast to come here is what is coming up next. New year, new opportunities could the recent dip in the home building space help you nail down some gains what you need to know out of the housing sector ahead. But first, Boeing and Nike both starting 2025 in the red and with 30% losses from both stocks in 2024 are those names in for another year of pain. You're watching fast money live from the Nasdaq market site in time square. We're back right after this. Global markets up to the minute front page news wake up to Frank Holland and worldwide exchange weekdays 5 a.m. Eastern CNBC live ambitiously. All right, welcome back to fast money a pair of big buzz kills to kick off 2025. Nike, tubbling, tumbling 2.6%. But we start with another blow for Boeing, the aerospace company, one of several US companies on China's latest export control list sanctions would ban imports to and exports from China or making new investments in the country. It's now down almost 5% just this week. So, Courtney, your thoughts on Boeing? Boeing's been tough. I mean, really for the last several years that you want to find an entry point into Boeing. It's a do opally and really whether it's them or airbests, like they need to keep making airlines. When you look at the airlines, I mean, there's just really not enough planes to go around right now. They need the more efficient planes and that demand is still there, but they just keep having issues. One thing after another. Why has it been such a mess for so long? I mean, your guess is good to mine. I'm not in management there, fortunately, but it just you think you're over one thing and it's just something completely unexpected, right? I mean, this recent news of a crash. I think we all thought we were past that and now it's another thing. I think that's become really frustrating for investors and it's hard to jump into something that just seems like such a, I mean, a mess for a lack of a better word from a management standpoint. Thoughts on Boeing? Yeah, I bought some Boeing a little bit after they did that very big capital raise of $24 billion. I mean, to me, that was really an important important event. We all know they've had tremendous issues that used to be really a great cash flow story and now it is a negative cash flow story. So that's a big change. But I think that when you're as down and out as Boeing, every little thing becomes a big thing that crashed the other day. It's terrible. I think this tension with China will continue, but I'm kind of intrigued by Boeing. I think that it didn't stop going down today, but it is generally stopped going down on bad news, even which, you know, Tim always says you make the most money when things go from terrible to just bad. So I'm long Boeing in the hope that it gets out of the terrible category. Right. All right. Let's move over to Nike now. It was down 2.6% in the first trading day of the year sales estimates for 2025 continue to fall. And let's predicting a 10% annual drop for this fiscal year, according to fact sets. So is it time guy to just sell it? We've been saying this for a while. I mean, Paul, the longer term chart of Nike and you'll see this is more than cut in half since it's all time high, thinking the summer of 2021. There are about and deservedly so. I mean, competition seemingly came out of nowhere and they weren't prepared for it. And quite frankly, it's still sort of expensive on valuation. It's flirting with the levels that we saw this summer 70 bucks or so. You know, to me, it feels like it's going to take it out and try to try to get test a whole new sort of level on the downside. I don't think in my opinion, there's not a compelling reason to own this not on valuation yet. And it's not on a turnaround yet. And the fact that the competition is only getting worse doesn't help them either. So I'm an avoid or of Nike still on one. I'm a very small position. I wouldn't sell it yet, only because I do believe in the long term story. And ultimately it's small enough and we've right sized it so that we can kind of play for any type of leg up. But I'm with guy. It's hard for me to really find some compelling catalyst. The issue is we need some exposure to retail within the portfolio. It's not as if we can invest completely in AI or completely in renewable energy. So from a portfolio standpoint, I can understand that you feel like you're picking amongst the upper echelon of retail. But they certainly need to get their act together and will probably hold off on investing. And guys point the competition has only become stiffer and stiffer for Nike. Let's take a quick break. Coming up, the big drop in mortgage demand is the housing market enters. It's annual winters free. Is it just a seasonal slump? Or is there even more weakness to come the outlook for home builders when fast money returns? Mr. Moment of fast catches any time on the go. Follow the fast money podcast. We're back right after this. Welcome back to fast money. Everybody stocks starting the new year off in the red despite all three indexes initially starting the day higher that out drop more than 150. The S&P and NASDAQ both down about two tenths of a percent both indexes riding five day losing streaks a rough end of the year. Longest since April by the way. Crypto starting the new year off however with a bang Bitcoin up 3% trading around $97,000 Ethereum and Solana also higher today. And shares of the biotech stock new mora therapeutics plummeting more than 80% today. It's worst day ever. It'll be my worst day. After the company's experimental depression drug failed to reduce symptoms in late stage trials to stock now worth about $300 million. That would take you into small cap territory. Meanwhile the home builder stocks in need of repair. Dear Horton a pulty group KB home linar falling double digits over the past month as mortgage demand slid to end the year. Often does that season link Diana Olick has the details. Hi Diana. It does usually that's right Tyler, but it did a lot this year total application volume for the two weeks ending December 27th drop nearly 22% compared with the week before that period. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association which did seasonal and holiday adjustments. Now during that time the average rate on the 30 year fixed increased to 6.97% from 6.89% for loans with 20% down rates were 21 basis points higher than they were the year before. And that's a change as they had been lower on an annual comparison for much of 2024. Applications for a mortgage to buy a home fell 13% during the two weeks and were 17% lower than the same period one year ago. Now December is typically the slowest month of the year for home sales, but the annual comparison still shows considerable weakness and that's why the home builders also had a rough end to the year. The ITB which is the home building ETF was down nearly 18% in the last month. Names like linar, pulty and DR Horton all way down in December after they had shot much shot much higher from July to November in anticipation of many more fed rate cuts. Which of course we know are not going to be as many as we thought Tyler. Alright Diana, thank you very much. Guy, what do you think of the home builders? Well if you believe the rates going higher which I do and if you think the unemployment rate is going higher which I also do it's really hard to make a compelling case here. People look at valuation, it's not about valuation. And you say how quickly these stocks can go lower. I mean pulp any one of the four you want and to move over the last couple of months has been staggering. And now all of the sudden middle of December you started to see down grades, Barclays downgraded three names, JP Morgan. I think you're going to see more and more people down grades. So people want to play, you know pick a bottom here. I think it's way too early to play that game right now in the home builders. I think there's more pain on the downside. Bonnewin? Pick I'm with a guy in terms of trying to catch a falling knife, but I do think the relative performance versus IYR is starting to get interesting. I would be IYR being the real estate ETF which has a lot of read exposure. So I would be looking at a pairstade where I'm using IYR as a source of funds and I'm deploying capital into ITB. And that way you're still net neutral the overall real estate subsector, but you know have long pockets of our performance of ITB versus IYR. And I think you're going to do like reets, do you like home builders, do you like any of it? Yeah, I think I think I think guy you bring up a lot of really good points. So I'm actually going to take the other side of this because I do think longer term. There is a really big structural demand problem. There are not enough houses to go around. I think there's like five million more households created over the last two decades and homes that have been built. And I think you're going to likely start to see some of this fatigue where afraid aren't coming down. Those buyers are going to start to come in. And when the current homeowners, mortgages are under four percent, they're not selling, which is where the home builders, they're the ones who can come in and they can't actually buy down rates or things like that to actually bring in the buyers. So I don't think this is a story that's going to end anytime in the near in the near term. I do think yes, short term there could be some pressure on it, but longer term. I don't think this is a story that's ending. If anything, you probably want to start to buy it in some of this week. So Courtney says long term, the home builders might be a place for some money. Do you agree? I think so. I mean, she talks with this really interesting dynamic of all of this stranded existing homes that aren't on the market because people have two cheap of mortgage. At some point, this might be a sweet spot for home builders in that that inventory isn't coming on yet. And yet there is this pent up demand that is enormous. And I think we'll see easier regulations to build homes. So I'm kind of inclined to take a shot on the home builders and they've come down a lot. I want to. No, it's all good. That's why it's market. It's not makes markets two sides of the story here. I just want to get see. All right, coming up high energy in 2025 oil stocks leading the charge in the New Year's first day of trading. So which names can keep powering higher? We will debate that went fast money returns. Welcome back to fast money everybody. Energy stocks powering higher today. The S&P energy ETF up 1%. It was the best performing sector today. Oil and gas producers seeing some of the biggest gains with the XOP ETF locking in an eighth straight session in the green longest streak in roughly a year. Those moves coming as Brent and West Texas crude prices each rose to their highest level since mid-October. A mid or more optimistic outlook for demand in China and maybe a chilly, chilly weather season guy. Karen's been talking about shinier LNG for years and it's had a little bit of a pullback off an all time high the last couple weeks. But it's back on its horse today and that gas is one of those stories that nobody's talking about. But it's more than double now since the spring. Deservedly so so the net gases and play without question those names work throw DVN into mix as well. But I think you're right to point it out. I mean crude oil is surprising people I think to the upside. It's been steady over the last couple weeks and I think there's just a matter of time before these energy stocks start to play catch up into the valuations. Exxon actually traded lower today probably on the back of the broader market. But I still like energy here energy. I do like energy but oh my god has it been frustrating for a couple of years and there's so many reasons to think it would be good with you know crane Russia still unresolved tensions in the Middle East. You know GDP being good here but it hasn't seemed to matter at some point I thought value will out I thought it would happen last year it didn't maybe this is the year guy. Maybe it's in your act or not I feel like the moves that we've seen today are indicative of flight to perceived safety and I think valuation and free cash flow generation are those perceptions of safety. We saw a similar situation with consumer staples where they weren't really offering much return but they were they were a perceived store of value. And I think that could be a lift for the energy sector I mean clearly it's under owned it's underperformed but I think that's. That really is what I think that's what we saw today right. All right thanks. Coming up two fast movers heading in different directions today the calls on Uber and so far the power the pop and drop more fast money in two. Welcome back everybody to fast money we got a call of the day on Uber shares are up nearly 5% Goldman Sachs added the ride shares stock to its conviction list analyst saying the company is still on track to meet its growth targets even amid autonomous vehicle hype. So I think that's a good idea to have a look at the first time I've seen a couple of years left also rising today nearly 6% new story from the information this afternoon suggesting that Amazon could acquire the company this year with the tech giant looking to scale its own robot taxi business Courtney thoughts on this space particularly Uber or either one of them. Yeah actually I like this call an Uber and I think this is something that has gotten lost in the conversation about time of his vehicles and people are saying oh that's going to be the end of Uber. So I think that's not going to be an issue for them and I think longer term they're likely going to be able to integrate it into their platform and could be a benefit for them. And I think they've been really strong showing how profitable they have been especially in an economy where the consumer is tight and they are starting to pull back on things they have continued to show that they are a company of strength here so I think looking at this is an opportunity could absolutely. If my son's bills are any indications Uber is going to do just fine. He's standing over there right now back is here. What are you doing man. You're using Uber. Shout about that. He uses Uber. Crazy as thing. He uses Uber a lot maybe wandered off. He's probably in an Uber somewhere. Son you're credit card. It's like you bet it's on my credit card. I mean you can see where he's going. Well I know what he I know when he's going. I don't see where really where. Real quick I'm with Courtney on this one to move from 87 to 60 pretty much in a straight line was way over done and if you look at where it held Uber it's the August 5th low. So good for Goldman Sachs on this call and I actually think Uber's one is going to surprise early this year as well. Alrighty. Let's move on to another big analyst call. Sofie sinking 8% after KBW downgraded the stock to underperform analysts saying the Fintech firms valuation looks overstretched also raising some concerns around whether the company can meet its long term growth targets model. And what do you think here on Sofie? Well this is a name that I like. I like the fact much like American Express. They seem like they're catering to a younger cohort and I think that's important that you get the pulse of what that consumer is doing. But the valuation I think it's 70 something odd on a Ford basis like 127 on a trailing basis. It's hard to argue it based on valuation with the over valuation. There you go. Alright, we're going to take a quick break. Come back do some final trades in just a minute or so. We'll see you after the break. Alright time folks for our final trade. Let's go around the horn.
