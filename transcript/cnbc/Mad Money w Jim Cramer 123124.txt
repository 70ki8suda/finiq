 It's CNBC's big January with CES from Las Vegas, Viotech and Farma at JPM Healthcare, the World Economic Forum in Davos, and the first Fed decision of the year. Start the year ahead of the game, CNBC. On Mad Money Tonight, Kramer will venture anywhere. A gigantic chevron floating production unit smacked in the middle of that golf on Mexico. Welcome to Dream Force Conference in San Francisco. I'm coming you from Cheese Kingdom. To speak to executives and leaders across Wall Street and beyond. From retail, to healthcare, to technology, and more. To bring investors the stories that matter to this market, Mad Money looks back at some of its biggest conversations of the year that brought home gamers inside into the headlines, trends, and state of the economy in 2024, starting now. Hey, I'm Kramer. Welcome to a special year and wrap-up edition of Mad Money. As we head into what will be our 20th year of Mad Money, we wanted to take a look back at 2024, and reminisce of some of the amazing places we got to visit, and people we got to speak to. We're traversing so many states and stock stories this year from cruise ships to oil rings, football stadiums, the theaters, and even some fantastic moments right here at the Stock Exchange. We can't possibly pick a favorite moment, although getting a robot to make me drink at the Nvidia conference might be up there. So tonight, we're bringing you a selection of some of the standouts of the year, starting with a trip we took way down south to Chevron's new offshore oil platform, Anchor, where we got to interview CEO Mike Worth, 140 miles off the Gulf of Mexico, Tagalog. Mike, we're on Anchor. To me, it seems like an engineering marvel, a technological marvel. How do you get it done? Well, it takes time. We started 20 years ago. When we first acquired at least 140 miles off shore 10 years ago, we made a discovery with a well from a drill ship. Five years ago, we had enough engineering done to make a final investment decision. Five years later, and over $5 billion of investment, here we are. So it takes time. It also takes every engineering discipline you can imagine. Marine engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, petroleum engineering, chemical engineering, coming together with the world's greatest suppliers to integrate these systems. It's like a small city out here. We've got to be self-sufficient. It'll be here for decades, and I'm really, really glad to host you. Okay, I've been on platforms before. I don't smell any oil. It seems self-contained. It seems low carbon. How's that possible? Well, our goal is to keep everything inside the pipe. In the old days, when you could smell things, it was because there were vapors getting out of the pipe. That's not acceptable today. It's not acceptable for our company. And so you've got to keep things inside the pipe. It's clean as can be. It's some of the lowest carbon intensity production in the world. The average carbon intensity for oil production runs 60 kilograms for barrel of oil, or 60 tons per barrel. This is about five. So it's low carbon intensity. There are no emissions. Nothing goes overboard into the water, other than very clean water. And that's the way we operate. All right, so tell me something. I got some of your crew right here. I buy a gallon of milk in New York City. It's $5. Paying $3 at the pump. All you got to do is milk the cow, put it in a carton. Oh, heat up the milk, and you got it, and they charge five. How are you able to... What is it taking to get it there to get in my pump? And how can you only charge three? Well, it's a global market for crude oil. And we've got to be efficient with our capital investment. We've got to be efficient with our operations. And frankly, the industry's got a history of finding a way to do things better and better, which continues to drive the cost down, which allows us to compete in the marketplace. And prices, really, if you look at them over a long, sweet, but time in you adjust for inflation, they really haven't gone up very much. And so it's all about continual improvement and efficiency in an industry that is a highly competitive industry. Mike, so tell me about this facility in particular, what cost more than five million, it's got many levels. Where's the oil from here? Well, the oil's coming from a few miles that way. It's going to come from a few miles that way. There's a big field. It's a field that's several square miles. We put a facility here. We have different drill centers on the seafloor, a mile beneath the surface of the ocean, and then we'll drill wells that reach out laterally from there, another mile, two miles. It all gathers along pipelines on the seafloor. And then we bring it up here, the ship that drills these wells, first of the kind, we worked with Trans Ocean to work at 20,000 pounds per square inch, which is the reservoir pressure. How much pressure is that? Give me like, how many pianos on a table, how many catapult, socks on a table? So imagine a bull grown male African elephant standing on a quarter. That's what the pressure is down in this reservoir. We've got to drop the drill pipe and pull drill pipe in and out of the whole 35,000 feet down, the ship killer. That's taller than ever. It's about the cruising height for a commercial jet liner. Three million pounds is the hook load on the crane, which is essentially equivalent to that crane on a ship out there lifting three fully loaded 747 airplanes. All right, so how can it be worth it? How many net barrels do you think are in this? How do you justify spending that money, especially when I know that we like sever on for the dividend? Well, we've got several hundred million barrels that we expect to produce out of this field over 30 years. So we take a long view on recovering our investment, which is a large investment. It's got a generator return and got a generate positive cash flow because the dividend matters to our shareholders. And we've got a strong track record on that dividend. No, I just don't know the stock in general. I find it's been held back because you're doing something with hast. That's under arbitration. We can't tell when that's going to be resolved. But it has hurt the valuation of the stock, even though I think if you get it, stock should go higher if you don't, you can do conventional because your conventional is strong. Well, look, our portfolio was very strong before we did the transaction with Hess. We had a great growth trajectory. Over the next several years, we're going to grow free cash flow at a 10% compound annual growth rate, which is what supports the dividend. Our dividend yields over 4%, which is three times the S&P. We've grown our dividend for 37 consecutive years. The last year is at a 6%, last decade at a 6% compound annual growth rate. So we're returning cash to shareholders over the last two years, dividend, and share repurchase more than $50 billion back to our shareholders. Okay. I appreciate that. Our viewers appreciate that. There are people look, but Kondo has been, and we all know it. It's a long time ago now. But what do you say to people? I would say, you know what, you can't really mitigate the damage here. There's nothing they can ever do. Offshore is too dangerous. Well, look, the Kondo incident was a horrible incident. And everybody in the industry recognizes that and has learned from that. So we operate at a much higher level of safety, even than we did. In fact, thank goodness our company's not experienced an event like that, but it could happen to anyone if we're not as diligent as we could be. So we pool resources to be prepared to respond to an event. But we've also raised the bar on the standards for our drilling operations out here in the deep water go up in Mexico. And at the first hit of a problem, you shut down and you go to a safe state. All right. Now on this platform, it seems like I see many, many people. How many are going to take to build? And how many people are here living or sleeping or going to the gym here? Well, it took thousands of people to build this. It was built in more than a dozen countries around the world and the pieces then come together. The equipment comes from suppliers around the world. The whole that we're floating on was done in a shipyard in Korea. The top sides were done in Corpus Christi, Texas. It's all integrated and then brought out here and anchored up. And so thousands and thousands of people over many years. Once we've got it installed, it's run with a pretty efficient crew. We've got maybe a hundred people on board at any time. They work 14 days on, 14 days off. Typically when they're on here, it's 12 hour shifts, 12 hours on, 12 hour, 24 or 7 back to back. So it's a relatively lean crew that runs it, but it's like a small city. All right. So a lot of people, we have two hurricanes. People worry about hurricanes. What can you tell people about this under these extreme conditions that could happen? Well, certainly when there's a hurricane, we evacuate our facilities. If there's any risk that it could be hit, we shut in the production. We take everything to a very safe state. The facilities designed for a thousand year storm. We've got 80 to 100 feet of free board between those surface of the water and the first deck on the platform. So we can take waves that are much higher than you see. And even the category five hurricane that just washed right underneath here. So it's designed to withstand more than the biggest storm that you would see here in the Gulf of Mexico. So we get everybody off and take it to a safe state when there's a storm in the region. That will do it. Mike Worth, Chairman, CEO of Chevron. Thank you so much. Thank you, Jim.

Plus, the first Fed decision of the year, the investing edge you need to start the year ahead of the game. CNBC. Larry, this was perhaps the most important of your letters and I read every one of them. And that's because, frankly, you are laying it out. There is a generation of people that will never, ever catch up unless they read this and understand, understand that as a nation, we just don't help. Look, I think I write about fear and hope. I think one of the major components of fear is for so many people about how can they have financial independence? But more importantly, for so many, how can you live your later years with dignity and decency? And we don't talk about the whole crisis of retirement. And this is not just a U.S. phenomenon. This is a phenomenon worldwide now. Last year I traveled to 17 different countries and I've never had more broad conversations about the need to think about retirement. Whether it's in a middle-class developing country or it's a very advanced developed country, they're rethinking about how should we be thinking about retirement. In the coming years, we're going to be doubling the number of people over 65 years old and we're not preparing society for that. And one of the big things for me, Jim, was there's not a day that doesn't go by. We don't talk about the miracles of drug discovery. Especially when we talk about the weight loss drugs and the power of what they're doing. The miracles of what they're doing in terms of helping kidney disease and joint diseases and heart diseases and diabetes. There's new miracles coming on related to dementia and the slowing down the pathway for dementia. We're extending life. These are miracles. These are blessings. But these are people, younger people, they don't know how to invest. They are scared to invest. They are intimidated. Yes. They don't feel they have a penny. They live one and worst of all, they do have no hope. And they tell you when you confront them, that that's the realistic position, no hope. Because our generation had reason to be hopeful and they don't. Well, I don't think also the younger generation knows where and who to listen to. Let's, you know, more of them are listening to some form of social media. They're not reading anything long form anymore. We were blessed that we had actually long form media where we really learned about issues and more fundamental issues. But even back 30, 40 years ago, we didn't talk about retirement. We never talked about things like retirement before. But now we must. We have no choice. You know, they feel that they can't afford to retire. They will work. This is disjuncted. They will work to let die because they have no money. They have huge college tuition. And no one tells them how to put money away and they would tell you what money. And the inflation has destroyed me. I'm 23 and inflation has already had the best of me. Well, when you and I were young, we actually had worse inflation than the young people did too. And we were able to find it out. It's in place. We had just, we had much larger inflation. So look, we're going to get by this. But we need to be thoughtful about how do we build that, that process. And look, I am bullish on the, on these young people. They're smarter than we were at our age. They have more global understanding of the world. They could, they're going to be put to work and, and have funny, wonderful opportunities. If they put their mind to it, if they have the energy behind that. But how do we do it? See, it is up to you and I. I mean, actually, it is. It really may be up to you and I. I mean, I, I, they feel disconnected. They don't want to put themselves in our shoes because they think our shoes are too big and it's ridiculous. They have no bootstraps. They lost their trust in the country. I think the lack of trust in our country is one of the huge issues of today because they don't know where and who to listen to. And I really do believe we as leaders, you, in your role, my, and we have larger responsibility of speaking the truth with facts, with consistency. And I think that's what my, my letter is doing. Talking about some of the big issues that we're afraid to talk about. You know, I'm an optimist. We always talk about high-manopathy. Yes, you and I both adopt. I'm an optimist because we talk about many of the problems. You read a friend page every day and it's full of, you know, problems. Right. However, what people don't realize is if we talk about these problems, we generally mitigate them. In fact, most times, the problems never get as severe as they are. What I worry about is when we never talk about these problems and the problems get worse. And to me, that's why I wanted to focus on retirement because this is something that we don't talk about. We put it under the table because it's not today's problems. It's not about the moment. It's about building a nest egg for retirement takes 30, 40 years. And so I understand a lot of young people don't even have the money to live a proper life. But there are many who are going to work, you get fine organizations, fine companies. And we all have that responsibility to help them down that pathway. One of the reasons that I really love this letter is it's filled with optimism. You generally leave if we can grow out of our problem, which people don't think we can. And you actually provide a solution. We have millions of jobs that couldn't be created, literally millions in our country by being pragmatic about energy. I thought it was terrific. Right. Well, this is a phrase that I've heard across the world that we have to be decarbonizing at the same time and we have to continue to be making sure that we have energy at an affordable level. And so we need to have the hydrocarbons today. And so this energy pragmatism that I heard worldwide, even countries that, but the ones that I'm here for so many countries, they are aggressively decarbonizing as fast as they can. But at the same time, if they're growing at 8% like in India, they're still using coal. And they must use coal because they don't want to be dependent on OPEC to buy more and more and more. So they're growing their economy. With more and more investments in energy, with decarbonization, but that's the future. This is why we're talking about infrastructure. We need to do more public private. We need more private capital. They're putting the work. And so then government can be spending more money on other issues. Now, there is a belief that with no cost coming down, with food being so expensive, with college tuition, leaving a lot of debt, that it's almost foolish to try to save. This is their view because how are they supposed to, hey, rent, if they're saving? Look, life is a full of trade-offs. I mean, we all have trade-offs. And if you don't have enough, you're rent, obviously, you're not going to save for retirement. But there are many people who are renting and having a role in a job that are ultimately through where their work, they're able to build some form and that's big. And the key is putting that money to work. It's not keeping money in a bank account. It's about the compounding of a return and building a retirement over a long period.
