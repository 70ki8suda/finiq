 CNBC has quick and easy to understand business news updates at the open midday and close every weekday Markets money and more from Wall Street to Main Street. I'm CNBC's Jessica at Ingrid follow and listen to CNBC business news updates Wherever you get your podcasts That now marks the end of regulation the sled ring in the closing building, you look stock exchange YSX tech doing the honors up in that deck and stocks jumped in yields pulling back as new data and fed commentary E some concerns about inflation in the path of rate cuts though the major averages closed well off the highs That's a scorecard on Wall Street But when they stay late welcome to closing bell overtime on John Fort with Morgan Brennan We have a big show coming your way Commerce secretary Gina Romando joins us with her warning about a potential government shutdown Plus the latest on new chips act grants and reports about a crackdown on Nvidia Plus former Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren who said he would have voted against a rate cut at this week's Fed meeting Ways in on the latest messaging from the Fed and this wild week of policy speculation Let's get straight now though to the market and this rally to end the week which started after a cooler than expected inflation read but really took off after Chicago Fed president Austin Gulsby told Squawk on the street this morning That rates could sure come down more take a listen They think that the ultimate rate is around 3% with inflation of 2% a real rate of 1% We're still above that so I still think it's meaningfully restrictive and that's why I say over the next 12 to 18 months If conditions keep on the way that they have over the last 18 months, I think rates come down a fair bit more Right exciting joining Stalas Paulson perspectives author Jim Paulson and unlimited CEO and CIO Bob Elliott guys happy Friday Jim We even with all of this done you think a noticeable gross slowdown is coming in the beginning of 2025 Which will cause an S&P correction drop of at least 10% then you think the market covers so If you're at home do you sell anything now or just buy big dips? I don't think you but I think you know forecasting short-term corrections John is always really perilous and I wouldn't advise doing that I wouldn't raise a lot of cash. I would I would advise it maybe investors do is defensive sectors have just gotten really beat up They're down on a relative basis dramatically. You know the utilities the Consumer Staples Farma S&P high high dividend High quality those kind of names you look at and maybe sell out some of the cyclical stars a little bit or lighten up on something like Consumer consumer discretionary or some financial that have done really well and just move the portfolio It's still invested but move it a little towards More defensive posture because you know, we haven't had a correction since October of 2023 and while everyone feels that things are good now Because the feds easing most other things are tightening you know the as soon as the feds card easing bond yields have gone up Almost a full percentage point on the 10 year the dollar in real terms is sore Which is a really contraction of force on industrial production and commodity prices money growth is only 3% John year on year Nommal GDP is 5 and whenever money growth is less than Nommal GDP real growth Slowed dramatically up more than a percent over the next year at least since 1960s So I think we're going to have a respite of recession fears again And then we're get a more dramatic downward move in the rate structure Which will bring that rally in the second hand. Okay, Bob. What do you say for 25 year? You're continuing to preach risk management Diversification even though it's not as exciting as some of the other options Well, I think the biggest things we enter into 2025 is it's it's time to curb your enthusiasm about this economy I mean we've seen GDP real GDP prints above 3% we see priced in ex earnings expectations Growth in 25 and stock market of 17 and a half percent and now we basically are having an interest rate curve That's pricing in no more or very few you know essentially one cut from the fed you put that together Basically the US economy has to perform At perfection in order to meet all that series of expectations and when you look at what's going on sort of cross asset that dynamic really favors at this point bonds and Gold to some extent relative to stocks where Basically any sign of a growth slowdown. You're probably likely to see some amount of rally in the choose A little bit of a rally on the long end and You know some in stocks coming under pressure early in 25 I'm hearing a fair bit of caution from both of you right now at least over the coming months But Jim you put out a really interesting notes and really interesting research post election a couple of weeks ago Where you took a look at what happens to the stock market when there is a pullback in public sector spending and activity Versus an increase in private sector and that is very much the narrative I mean, well, I realize lots of question marks on how we get there and all the policy lift that has to happen to get there But that is very much the narrative alongside an incoming Trump administration. How does that factor in here? Well, I think it does Morgan and you know what Bob and I both talking about is maybe a correction here and in the first half of the year Sometime, but I don't think From my perspective at least I think this bull market's got a ways to go yet. I really do and I think Bull markets that last correct along the way refresh if you will and I think that's all we're talking about Because to your point we've got some really marvelous things in the background I think that the technology run we've had in this country is already paying dividends It's one of the reason that we're growing at 3% real GDP when when job creation is only about 1% or by the household numbers flat It's because we're we've created such so many new innovative tools that's allowing us to grow even with with slow labor growth in the economy That's a wonderful result for prolonged bull market event on top of that is to your point We've gotten the agenda ahead and it looks more at boosting private sector Activities and reducing public sector activities and man that has been a winner not only for economic performance historically But also for the stock market if we get into a real economy driven private sector driven economy With the with the shrinking public sector supporting that I think this bull is long from over so I you can't get too cute worried about a correction a 10-15% correction It will mean nothing if this bull continues particularly if it continues on the back of the technology dominance of the United States and on the back sector growth all right so Bob you've been talking a lot Including on X where you've been pretty spicy about this you've been talking a lot about this over easy trade So even though we had a Fed that cut Very hawkish commentary. Yes, we just played goals be but even some of the other other officials We've heard from in the past call it 24 hours have tilted a little more hawkish looking to 2025 in part because of policy uncertainty on the fiscal side And into anticipation about what that could mean for inflation So what do you feels like The market is currently over easy and if that trade is done where do you go now? Yeah, I think the over easy trade, you know really basically Called the last three months Almost perfectly and and at this point that trade is largely run. I think in part because What's happened is we've sort of reprised an expectation that the Fed is going to be very tight at this point Right with only roughly one cut priced in in 2025 and that I think is reflective of the fact that at this point, you know Analysts expectations for US growth in 25 are you know two and a half percent real growth may maybe as high as three Those are all very very high expectations relative to an economy that is facing higher rates on the long end In you know long end rates at four and a half and higher We've seen a couple of times in the last few years start to drag on the economy both directly through you know higher mortgage rates But also through financial asset prices and so we probably can't take it this highs Continuation without getting some slowdown that's going to disappoint expectations make sense Bob Jim have great weekend Thanks for joining us We've got some breaking news on the Qualcomm arm trial over a licensing dispute between companies see Has that seen John and Morgan the Qualcomm AMD legal dispute that this trial started back on Monday and the jury is said now to be deliberating over Whether there was in fact a breach in the licensing agreement between these two semiconductor companies some headlines emerging from Reuters They're reporting that the US jury finds Qualcomm did not breach new vies license agreement with arm holdings Which is what arm was accusing Qualcomm of the US jury also finding Qualcomm's customs CPUs are licensed under its deal with arm I'm told by a source in the room how I've just been texting with that these deliberations are said to be ongoing So be looking for more headlines and what comes out of this trial again and began Monday and the jury started to Come together yesterday. We'll see if we can get something by the end of the day But in the meantime we are watching shares of Qualcomm move higher as these headlines emerge by 2.5% and over time John and Morgan Morning, this looks like potentially a huge win for Qualcomm Qualcomm have the most to lose here in the sense that The architectural license it's not that dragon their strategy is very much grounded in that But then at the same time arm is really trying to make the case that their IP they're trying to own it more Make more money off of it This is is going to dent their chances of being able to make that case more broadly as folks like apple Do more of their own thing the jury seems to be saying That the new via and Qualcomm innovations weren't so dependent on arm at least from a legal standpoint which We'll see what the implications are there. Yeah, you've been following this been very closely into your point Qualcomm shares And now up 2% and arm is down about 2% on this outcome Well now let's turn to senior markets commentator Mike Santoli He's tracking the markets wild action this week and Mike it has been wild Yeah, it has more and especially below the surface But even the s and p 500 had a more dramatic move this week a 3% down day almost on Wednesday It looks still on the orderly side on a year-to-day basis what did happen was the index went down and checked right back to the Election day levels and back toward those October highs It seems more like a little bit of a reset or rebasing Let's test to see if those levels are trustworthy although in the beginning of December I was pointing out like 6100 on the s and p was widely considered a potential upside, you know destination Technically speaking for a variety of reasons we basically just about got there And then if back to off a lot of people are going to view that as a potential Upside ceiling until proven otherwise take a look here though at the action in the s and p in 2018 into 2019 because there were a little stirrings of Familiarity with this idea of a steep December selloff which happened in 2018 also being accompanied by fed rhetoric that was perceived to be too hawkish for the economy in the market to handle And you did have an instance where that December seasonal strength did not really show up until the final couple days That was a real selling crescendo on culminating around Christmas Eve Now I would say big difference here. We've been going down in 2018 since early October So it was definitely a more mature selloff and a deeper one almost got to 20 percent So that's one big difference and also the fed was tightening into that as opposed to just removing potential Ray cuss but worth keeping in mind you don't always get a strong and calm December finally stocks versus bonds on a quarter to date basis One of the things that happened in the end of 2018 that selloff was it was a huge rebalancing back into equities By a lot of these sort of target date funds you do have some spread here where bonds of really that's a bond market Totally underperformed on a quarter to date basis. So that's not necessarily going to be net benefit to stocks if we do get some rebalancing But the moves here aren't as dramatic Necessarily to be too decisive going into year-end Morgan Mike, I love that you just put into context what we saw with the market with a last shut down from 2018 to 2019 Really great stuff. We're gonna see you later this hour makes this past week look a little bit less scary probably a hundred percent Yeah, all right Well, we're gonna stick with the shutdown and just a reminder here on some key dates that you need to remember the new congress meets Exactly two weeks from today January 3rd. You've got a new president starting January 20th So let's turn now to Emily Wilkins in Washington for the latest and we're a thing stand ahead of that midnight deadline Emily the part that I keep thinking about is with a January 3rd new congress coming in could we just go from potentially a shutdown if we don't get a CR to an actual budget, which is several months overdue already Morgan, I mean that is a great question if you remember though trying to put together the fiscal 2025 spending it does usually take a while to come together There were a lot of lawmakers that were hoping that was gonna be the bill they were working on now instead of continuing 2024 but look we just saw a Republicans meet in the house. We saw them come out with a lot of optimism a speaker Mike Johnson just flat out said They'd be able to avoid a shutdown or at least a long shutdown take a listen to what he said We have a unified Republican conference. There is a unanimous agreement in the room that we need to move forward I will not telegraph to you the specific details of that yet because I've got a couple of things I got to wrap up in a few moments upstairs But I expect that we will be proceeding forward. We will not have a government shutdown and we will meet our obligations for our farmers You need aid for the disaster victims all over the country and for making sure that military and essential services and everyone who relies upon the federal Programming for a paycheck is paid over the holidays. I'll give you the more details here in just a few moments So a lot of obviously momentum and confidence there from the speaker the details as we understand them is that it's going to be one bill Past in an expedited vote so they'll need democratic support and that will include funding the government at 2024 levels from now until March 25th It will include that hundred billion dollars in disaster aid for areas hit by hurricanes It will include assistance for farmers. However, like so much of this process It has been hurry up and wait We haven't heard anything else from the speaker. We haven't heard any additional details We don't even know when or if the house is going to vote and we don't know if Democrats are going to be going along with Republicans if they decide not to this planned vote that they've talked about might not be able to actually pass And even if the house does get its job done then you have the Senate and that does take a while over there Meanwhile, it seems like Elon Musk has begun tweeting again Initially, it seems like Republicans were going to take a slightly different course of action where they were going to vote on each piece that I just described one at a time instead of all together And we just had Musk to tweet in a question is this going to be a Republican bill or a Democrat bill? So it seemed like there was a lot of optimism just a short time ago I think now there are lots of questions about why it's taking so long and what's going to happen next But if anything it does seem like we're headed for at least a short shutdown that could be into the weekend I think the question is doesn't go much longer than that Morgan John Emily thanks a lot of characters in this story and hours to go After the break we'll talk to Eric Rosengren the former head of the Boston Fed about the comments from Austin Gullsby that pushed the market higher today And if you think it's the right message Don't miss our exclusive conversation with commerce secretary Gina Ramondo with her take on the possible shutdown And what could happen to chips act funding when the truck administration takes over over time it's back and two CNBC has quick and easy to understand business news updates at the open midday and close every weekday Markets money and more from Wall Street to Main Street I'm CNBC's Jessica Attinger Follow and listen to CNBC business news updates wherever you catch your podcasts Welcome back to overtime stocks rallying today as the PC price index came in lower than expected and after Chicago Fed President Austin Gullsby told CNBC that rates could fall Further next year. Well joining us now is former Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren who said before this week's Fed meeting on the show That if he were still at the Fed he would be voting against a cut It's great to have you back on to bookend the week here and we did get that hawkish cut the market certainly reacted strongly to it in a negative fashion on Wednesday and even into Thursday What do you think now especially given the fact that whether it was Fed share a pal or a number of other officials maybe ex Gullsby in the last 24 hours There's been a lot of talk about concern about a reigniting of inflation possibly tied to fiscal policies which we don't actually know what those are going to look like Yeah, I think that's the big challenge right now is we really don't know what the fiscal policies will be We do know if there's a lot of talk about immigration tax cuts and tariffs all of which directionally potentially Could be inflationary, but we don't know the magnitude we don't have Any details and some of them may be negotiating comments that May not happen at all So I think there is an unusual amount of policy uncertainty Usually monetary policy doesn't spend too much time worrying about fiscal policy because it tends to be slow moving But a lot of the things that could be coming up shortly after the inauguration Could be done by executive order So I think in the next month or two we'll start getting a little more clarity on what policies could occur and whether or not They really have much of an inflationary impact What do you think about financial conditions right now are they are they too easy Well, the stock market even though it went down quite a bit after the Fed meeting it's still relatively high by historical standards Obviously bitcoins some of the other measures of kind of speculative desires to see prices go up are are still fully valued So I don't think it's particularly restrictive given the conditions that we have in financial markets right now So you're given that do you think Markets are responding reasonably to a what the Fed is doing but maybe more important or just as important What a Trump administration Is likely to do with policy people might start Reacting to likelihood before the policies actually start to affect the data So I think we've seen some of that just with the Fed announcement So it wasn't a particular surprise that it was a hawkish cut and I think what was a little bit of a surprise Was the summary of economic projections only had two cuts for next year and I think some of the language at the press conference Indicated that at least some people were taking into account potential fiscal actions That could be inflationary so I think it just elevated the concerns that if there are inflationary policies On the fiscal side that monetary policy you'll have to react to that So we'll see if they actually come to fruition or not But I do think that If we get a set of fiscal actions that end up being inflationary It will make it very difficult for the Federal Reserve to cut particularly As much as the markets were expecting prior to the last FOMC meeting Eric Rosengren great to have you on thank you Thank you When we come back Conor secretary jenna remundo joins us with her thoughts on the potential government shut down the future of the chips act And reports about a crackdown on Nvidia chips in China. That's next You know CNBC has quick and easy to understand business news updates at the open midday and close every weekday Markets money and more from Wall Street to Main Street. I'm CNBC's Jessica at Ingrid follow and listen to CNBC business news updates wherever you catch your podcasts Welcome back earlier today. I sat down exclusively with commerce secretary jenna remundo for a wide-ranging interview That started with the prospect of a partial government shutdown come midnight and what that would mean for her department It's so unfortunate and I think embarrassing that we're in this position. There's no need for it I hope congress can get its act together this weekend and and pass a bipartisan Resolution so we can keep the government open that being said We're preparing, you know, it will be disruptive. It will slow us down people will get hurt I'm focusing on the national security aspects of our job prioritizing what must get done and you know We'll do our best Morgan, but to me it's just so heartless what this means is that I will have people Here at the commerce department working and not getting paid, you know not getting a paycheck the week before Christmas You're gonna have a federal employees working through Christmas at airports military members working through Christmas Without getting paid, you know forget about politics. That's just mean spirited. It's wrong headed It makes it weakens America and I just hope that congress can prevent that So what do you see as the national security aspects and I asked that knowing that just earlier today you've put three more chips act awards Or announcements of those awards out Samsung Texas instruments and amcourt Yes, you know, I have to say on a happier note It's pretty incredible all of the national security work that the team here at the commerce department has done in the past couple of years I remember Morgan talking to you a couple of years ago There was no chips team at the commerce department. There was the chips act had just been passed And today we have a couple hundred people working We've made 30 grants to some of the best companies in the world Texas instruments TSMC Samsung etc. We're on our way to being the only country in the world That designs manufacturers and packages leading edge Semiconductors in our country We've invested more than 90% of the money that congress gave us and that makes America stronger It makes us less reliant on other countries For the semiconductors that we need to run our businesses run the military and be a leader in AI You just said 90% you expect to be 200% come January? Very very close as you said earlier I hope we keep the government open. I hope everybody can keep working But we would like to be almost down just about done Is there any possibility because we've heard some rhetoric out there that perhaps some of these big tentpole Policies including this one from from this current administration that there may be With a new administration a new congress coming in Some attempts to pull back or scale back some of the funding that's gone out Is that something that could actually happen or is once these grants and once these funds awarded that's it You know look anything can happen theoretically it would be incredibly unlikely For a few reasons you know we've made we've made legally binding commitments to these companies So these companies can and should expect that the US government Will make good on its promises and the contracts But also the chips act is still very popular With Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill. I was on Capitol Hill earlier this week briefing Members of Congress Republicans and Democrats both very interested in it It's a national security initiative. It was passed by partisan. It remains by partisan by the way You know the initiative began in the Trump administration my predecessor will beros Worked with Trump's Secretary of State to try to attract TSMC to America. So I I'm really not very worried about that. It's a right thing to do for America and I expect that it will continue I also ask the secretary whether reports are true that the Commerce Department has asked in video to look into how its products ended up in China over the past year And if so how big of a concern it is Any time we have any evidence of companies Chinese companies or any companies Um trying to circumvent our controls. It's a concern It's absolutely a concern. You know the Chinese determined to get our technology We're ahead of them and they want what we have I'm just as determined to deny them that technology So uh, we're constantly talking to industry Invidia, but all companies. I have to say one of the things I'm really proud of Morgan is since I've been in this job I'm constantly engaging with industry. So we have the ground truth. What's really going on out there? Um, and so yes, we're doing that all the time. We don't have any particular thread with in video right now But what we're always talking to companies. What are you seeing on the ground? How could China be You know setting up you know fake companies or shell companies or p obo boxes to get our chips and Doing an end run around our regulations so that we can tighten the loopholes Um, we can be more effective While it's quote never ending relentless competition Secretary Remando says there is no question the administration has been effective encountering China's efforts to get key technology pointing to recent export controls on chipmaking equipment done alongside the Dutch and Japanese for example We also discussed AI and the fact that the role of commerce has evolved and expanded to include more policy at the intersection of technology and national security Now in light of that I asked what her message is for her successor nominee and cantrafits Gerald CEO Howard letnick I have reached out to him. I've told them I'll do whatever I can to help him be successful Uh, I predict it'll be the best job he's ever had Now he's a very successful person already, but the commerce department is a special place It's at the center of national security the center of AI chips technology The center of trade and working with our allies and they're incredible people who work here You know 50,000 employees all over the world doing great work on behalf of our great country So You know my advice is Continue we have we have made the commerce department under president Biden's leadership of you know more muscular more robust place More active in national security and tech policy You know stay there engage fully As for what's next Secretary Remando says right now she's focused on finishing this job calling it an honor of a lifetime and though not saying yes Also Not ruling out when I asked her a future run for president the entire 17-minute interview is on cmbc.com take a listen or take a watch all right great stuff at an important time Well time for cmbc news update with cma modi cima John german officials say at least one person is dead and at least 60 more were injured after a car drove into a Christmas market in eastern Germany today in a suspected deliberate attack that's according to local german officials who say the driver was arrested and believed to be from Saudi Arabia main time the white house had quote impermissible under influence undo influence over a national security review of its nearly $15 billion deal to acquire U.S. steel that's according to nipon steel now in a letter to the committee on foreign investment in the United States Nipon steel threatened to sue if the deal is blocked the committee which reviews foreign acquisitions for potential national national security risks has until Monday to make a decision to the deal And over a two-day period doctors at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center saved the lives of 10 organ recipients in a synchronized 20 person transplant According to the hospital five kidney donor and five kidney recipient surgeries were performed each day And it is considered one of the largest ever living kidney donor transplant chains completed in one week Pretty incredible John wow cima. Thanks Well up next to mercers u.s chief investment officer or where she sees the biggest risks and potential rewards in 2025 Be right back You Welcome back stocks ending the week with a major rally but the down in s and p could close out December with their worst performance since April Joining us now is allow a gonga she is the u.s chief investment officer at Mercer allow a great to have you that here on set So for 2025 you think u.s stocks do pretty well, but not as well as Japan Uh, yeah, I mean look right now we've seen just even the equity flows for November. What is it 140 billion in u.s Stocks is the highest that we've seen in 20 years right so 350 billion just year to date Um with the incoming administration. There's a lot of enthusiasm for the u.s market It's clearly an America first type of agenda that we've seen personally from a tech class at allocation perspective We are somewhat neutral But we've been looking for opportunities that we can invest in For prolonged periods of times more themes Thematic opportunities that can persist through some of the noise that we're seeing So a couple of examples AI of course we've seen that happen But AI driving productivity growth So natural language processing Perhaps machine learning so partnering with private equity companies in a deal environment that's conducive for that To be able to invest The other aspect that we've been looking at as well another theme. It's more called the security of everything So whether it's cyber security This geopolitical environment anything that can protect supply chains So investing in those types of companies, but again, it's more prolonged at what point do the Trump administration's Policies cease being noise right and start being something that you can really invest based on And find real advantage. How do you figure out when that moment is They will have to come in and we have to see what can actually get enacted the number one thing that's been a big focus is the tariffs Right, so potential 60% on China 10% on a number of other places We've seen the market performance of China even we've seen the one-year rate to dip below 1% right like that We haven't seen an incredibly long time So tariffs is one But then that also has bigger implications so potential inflation right so 2025 we're expecting significantly more rate cuts now if we see the median dot plot is like two Maybe right to 50 basis points But if all of these things can be enacted it's the fallouts from tariffs And what is happening interesting? I mean you just mentioned that you're tactic tactically neutral why and how much and how much of the policy noise Chained you know does that hinge on and and would change that that neutralness so Technically neutral because of the uncertainty and I mean debt ceiling aside or so talk about uncertainty So what we've done just taking a little bit of a step back to see okay if 25 basis point rate cut that we've just seen you know potential 50 basis point by the end of 2025 What other opportunities could we have one would assume in a Environment where rates are going lower it would mean that we would start looking longer out in the curve Maybe looking for more fixed-income opportunities there We're not seeing it our clients aren't seeing it in the longer part of the curve It's still more the corporate pension to find benefit plans and those are hedging liabilities So those opportunities haven't opened up quite yet despite the fact that rates are going lower So that's where you know we're waiting to see how things just really filter in great to get your inside look a lot Thanks, thank you From Mercer we got more breaking news on the continuing resolution out of Washington Emily Wilkins back with that Emily Hey John well, I said it was hurry up and wait and I think we're in hurry up mode again We now have the bill text for the third attempt to make sure that the government continues to be funded after midnight tonight The house is expected to be voting basically around five sometime between five and five thirty And what members decided to do the Republican members They decided that this should be a vote done as quickly as possible They're using an expedited process that allows them to quickly vote and get this bill to the Senate if it passes But it does need democratic support to pass and we know that not every Republican will be voting for this bill A thing to definitely keep an eye out for here is how many Republicans vote yes Remember one of the sort of the underlying stories of all this has been the support behind speaker Mike Johnson Remember he has to win that gavill back at the start of the next Congress and there are some members who are unhappy with him at this point I know at least one member congressman Thomas Massey who I spoke with today He says he's not planning on voting for this He still has concerns about Johnson But the same point there is a lot of hope that now that the debt limit is removed from this bill It can get the support from some other Republicans who voted no last night as well as Democrats And of course one that is done if it passes It will now be up to the Senate to complete it see if they can do so before midnight or whether we might have a slight shutdown going into the weekend Guys busy Friday night Emily Wilkins. Thank you for bringing us the latest Up next Mike Santoli breaks down what history says today Today's big inflation reading could mean for the Fed and the market Welcome back the PCE price index inflation reading for November came in lower than estimates But it's still higher than the Fed's 2% target Mike Santoli's back to explain how today's reading could predict the Fed's next move Mike Yeah, it's a bit open ended John why investors are a little bit uneasy with this recent stall out in PCE inflation both at headline and core levels on the far end there you see how in recent months just Curled higher just a little bit What I wanted to point out with a very long term chart going back to 1990 is that these absolute levels are really not that remarkable that we've kind of been able to coexist with them with relatively stable Interest rate it did not mean if you got one of these little bumps that it was the new leg higher for inflation In fact back here in the 90s when the Fed had a very very aggressive 1994 tightening campaign took its foot off the break going into 95 only did three rate cuts if it just did three Rake cuts they don't went on hold for this entire period or much of that period in there Just tweaking things around the edges. So there is precedent for stable, but slightly still down trending inflation So I would say you know the reminder today from Chicago Fed president Austin goes we were not at target But it doesn't mean we're not headed there and at least for now leaving wide open the idea that the Fed could nudge rates lower in the context of a decent economy All right Mike Santoli. Thank you.
