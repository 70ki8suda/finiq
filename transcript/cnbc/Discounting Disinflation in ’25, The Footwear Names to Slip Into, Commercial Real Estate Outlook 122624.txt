 Get a head start on 2025 with CNBC's big January, the hottest tech event, CES from Las Vegas, the data, the jobs report, and meet the future of Biotech and Farma at JPM Healthcare. Check out the MX Golf Tournament from California, inauguration day, and the meeting of world leaders in Davos Plus the first Fed decision of the year. The investing edge you need to start the year ahead of the game. CNBC You're listening to the Exchange. Here's today's show. Thank you very much, Frank. Welcome to the Exchange. I'm Kelly Evans and here's what's ahead. We'll start with yields, the 10 year, back above 4.6% to its highest level since early May. The markets are pricing in just two rate cuts next year after last week's hawkish Fed cut. But David Zervos says monetary policy is already too restrictive. He expects a dovish turn in the second half of 2025. He'll tell us how he's positioning and why coming up. And Donald Trump's posting a untruth social on Christmas, suggesting the US take over the Panama Canal, Greenland as we've heard, even Canada. We're going to dig into the viability of those suggestions actually and the impact it's all having on international relations. Plus, here's a look at our mystery chart of the day. Well, it is Thursday. We could day after Christmas, we got to give you at least one, up 20% in the past month, and one analyst top pick for next year. We'll reveal the name and a few other stocks you may want to slip into. There's your hint in the new year. Let's get down to Bob Bessani first, though. He's got the latest on today's market action. Bob, where's my Santa Claus rally? Yeah, we were fine up until 45 minutes ago and we were all positive on the major indexes. In the last 45 minutes, we slipped. I think that might have something to do with what Kelly was mentioning with the 10 year yield now at the highest level since May. $1 has been strong as well. But anyhow, we were positive on all three of these indexes now, not, but remember something. This has been pretty good. The S&P and the NASDAQ are both less than 1% from a new high. Dow and dust drills. Let's look at the Dow, some of the stocks moving in the Dow here. The industrials were helped all day. We had another strong performance today by United Health. It's been bouncing back to less what four or five days after awful first part of December, just awful. Bowing great month, up 70%. The problem with bowing is great month, terrible year. It's still down 30%. It's one of the worst performers. Maybe Nike is about neck and neck down 30% on the year. Goldman Sachs, a continuing trend of lower financials generally in December. Here's another good example. Great year for Goldman in general, bad month. This is true of most of the financials. Great year, bad month. Same with Home Depot. Really just sort of the opposite. A poor month at a kind of a middleing year, Home Depot up about 14%. It's been bouncing around a lot here. Big cap tech mixed today. Apple, Broadcom, we're leading Amazon, Meta, excuse me, and Tesla lagging as you can see here. Of course, everybody is talking about Apple, one of the few stocks at new highs right now. Apple close to that $4 trillion market cap. And as we've been saying all day, $264.63 is the price it would have to have to hit. A $4 trillion market cap. And as you can see, we're still shy of that, although Apple is up today. How about that Santa Claus rally? Kelly was referencing. So this is the tendency. You all know the S&P 500 to rise in the last five days of the old year, the first two, the new year started on Tuesday. And so far, we're up about 1%. We were up 1.1, 1.2% earlier, but we've come off of that highs. Finally, I just want to know something approaching the end of the year. Not only is the S&P up 27% or so. But the advanced decline line really looks quite good here. For all these complaints about big cap tech dominating, the marketplace, if you look at the numbers, two thirds of the S&P 500 are up on the year. That's a really good number. One third or down. And 53 stocks, Kelly, in the S&P 500 are up 50% or more. Look at that. 53 are up more than 50% or more. 51 or 10% or down 10% or more. But that's an awful lot of stocks. And of course, as you all know, the top 10 mega cap stocks tend to dominate here. But overall, this is not a bad year for the overall market. Kelly, back to you. All right, Bob. Thank you very much. Bob Asani. Despite sticky inflation, my next guest thinks the Fed is too restrictive. Saying Powell will eventually settle for a policy kind of like two and 20, meaning a flat yield curve at around 2% and a Fed balance sheet at 20% of GDP. David Servos is here. He's chief market strategist at Jeffries and a CNBC contributor. It's great to have you here, Dave. Thank you so much. Good to be here, Kelly. I think the big 30,000 foot picture of what you think next year will look like is actually disinflationary. And we should talk about that, especially on a day where yields are doing what they're doing. So maybe you can talk us through why. I mean, I think the biggest story in the Trump agenda trade is deregulation. And deregulation is not talked about enough. Everybody's focused on tariffs, immigration, more stack flationary parts of the proposal, which I think are much smaller and much less significant than the deregulation. And I think that was true in 1718 and 19 as well when he pursued a huge deregulatory agenda. But do the effects of deregulation take time to show up? I think a lot of people might say he was sure in the long run, and maybe they mean 10 years, and he's only got four, right? But do you think they could literally show up within a couple of months time? I do because I think businesses are going to start planning for the next four years. They're going to know that they can do deals. They're going to know that things are going to move again. And so all of that planning comes in, all of that investment comes in, all of that decision making to get together. And I think cut costs and merge and engage in activities that are ultimately going to be benefiting from the fact that there's less red tape involved in getting business done. I love this because what you're saying is actually even more of a twist than I think people might think when they think deregulation, they think of the really hard stuff. The kind of stuff that Musk and Ramaswami are going to be chipping away at dollar by dollar at a time, again, take a while. What you're really talking about is just a looser M&A environment, which can happen on day one. And you think more M&A is basically disinflationary for the economy. It just brings business optimism. It's the NFIB survey. It just brings people to the table to get the animal spirits flowing. And I think that is optimistic for all business. It's optimistic for the cost of production and the expected cost of production for businesses to be lower. And that allows for room for prices not to go up as much in margins to be higher. Do you can we do some myth busting? Sure. I think a lot of people think that M&A, they always say, what are the lines I hear they say, deals often fail to bear any real returns. It's anti-competitive. It's bad for the consumer. Does result in a lot of layoffs and restructuring in the near term. So what about all of those kinds of dismissals of the impact of M&A? It can be constricted for the labor markets. It certainly has been in the past deregulation and certainly innovation and what we're talking about with Doge as well. So all of those, I think, are variables we need to put into 2025 and 2026. I just think the question of speed is important, what you brought up in the beginning. That to me is much more of an optimism, a mindset, a psyche that's going to come in. And I think businesses are going to be even confident that they don't need to raise prices. They can keep prices here or even lower them if they expect their cost structures to be going down in the future. And that's the way they can gain real estate with market share. And that's going to be an important thing. As deregulation really lowers the barrier to entry for all newcomers, for smaller businesses, for those guys that want to chip away at the bigger, in scanced businesses. So I'm excited about that. I also, as you pointed out in the opening, have a very controversial view on the structure of rates and where neutral is. And the Fed, and maybe you can get into that. What do you, and as you've pointed out, they've actually done a lot of shrinking of the balance sheet. We were over 9 trillion and we've come all the way down to the high sixes now, six change. It's only almost 7 trillion. Yeah. Where is it going? And what's the impact of all of this? I think from, you know, to not to get too wonky and to go back too much, we spent a lot of time over the last two years telling our clients that the balance sheet was still exerting stimulative pressure on the economy. And that's why the high rates weren't having the same impact. So we were actually in the higher for longer camp. We were sat on the show with you and many others saying, this is not going to be the rate cuts that people think are coming, but what's priced into the market. There's just too much stimulus from the balance sheet side. The balance sheet is now kind of off the table in terms of the stimulus. It's back to what I would consider a neutral level, probably by the middle of the year. So about 20% of GDP. Okay, so six point, maybe we get to what, six in change by the middle of next year. Six and a half, but remember, GDP's going up as well. Okay. So that the economy's still expanding 5% in nominal terms. So that means the net. It's almost normal, which is shocking because to a lot of us, it still feels like this is highly abnormal. Right. But you're saying 20% of GDP is actually a level. So that's the 20% effort. It's where we were at the end of 2019 when we weren't doing QE anymore. We weren't doing QT anymore. That was kind of the stable balance sheet level that we got to and everybody felt comfortable with. So if we're there, I don't think you have that offset anymore. And to me, I go back and think, well, what's the neutral rate structure and that neutral rate structure that was in place in 2019 was around 2%. And it was a couple hundred basis points lower than it is today or more. So you think for everyone who says in the Fed itself who says, okay, you know what, market, we hear you, we see what's going on out there. Lot of the rate cuts without we're coming are off the table. Do you think by three or six months from now, they're actually going to be saying the rate cuts are back on? I think the inflation data is the sort of, is the real crux of this story. And if I'm right and monetary policy is a little more restrictive than we think it is. And the deregulation story is dominant. Both are going to exert pressure on prices down. The deregulation story should be good for growth. The restrictive monetary policy should be bad for growth. They might net out or one might dominate a little, probably dereg dominates. But you're going to see it play out in prices. And I was kind of happy to see the PC miss last week. I think a lot of people were. I was one of the first to see the market didn't have a bigger reaction. I'm surprised too, because it's the first time we really saw one of those point ones come in that was like, oh, wait, that missed by a tenth to the downside. Like the old days when it always used to miss by a tenth to the downside. But we said, okay, well, that's just the way the world is. I felt good about that. I felt like that was the sort of canary in the coal mine a little bit singing to me, saying this thing is really going to change next year. And it's because I believe policymakers are misinterpreted neutral. And I believe a lot of the market is misinterpreted neutral. And I love being on the other side of this. It just makes me happy. So final and very practical question, then, do you think you can be a buyer both stocks and bonds here? Spooz and Blues. Spooz and Blues. I mean, we were in it this year. It did great. You know, the Blues didn't do as well. They were a little bit of an offset minor, like 7% off the 28% that the S&P's total return. So still a great year in that trade. But I think it's even better this year. I think the fixed income side isn't even better insurance policy if something goes wrong. So my likely storyline is going to be to stay with what we did for all of 2024, which worked really, really well. And I expect it's going to work possibly even better in 2025. We will leave it right there. Dave, always a pleasure. Thank you. Good to see you. Good to see you. Dave and Sirvose with Jeffries. And while markets focus on the Fed, President-elect Trump is getting a list of potential political targets. Here's a roundup of headlines from the past 24 hours. Axios reporting that Denmark bolstering Greenland defense after Trump calls for the U.S. to own the territory. The Washington Post says Trump's Panama Canal threats are designed to scuttle China influence. Business Insider headline reads, Trump urges Wayne Gretzky for Canadian Prime Minister, as Justin Trudeau could be on the brink of losing power. It's kind of a... I was going to say fun time to be alive. My next guest says it's a far more dangerous world now, though, for Trump than in his first term. And how China responds will be key, joining us as Fred Camp, he's president and CEO of the Atlantic Council and a C&BC contributor. But I... Truth is stranger than fiction here. Just talk us through the impact this is all having it. And what it... It's all... What does it all mean? Well, first of all, it means get ready for a free-wheeling president who's going to conduct a very unorthodox foreign policy. I don't know, Kelly, how you spent your Christmas day, but the president-elect was on social media talking about expanding American territory to the Panama Canal, to Greenland, and to Canada. And as you noted, the Greenland Prime Minister, by the way, that's part of Denmark, it's a territory of Denmark, said it's not for sale. And the Panamanian president had to answer that, no, we control it, we're not going to give it up. And Trudeau didn't really respond at all, although Trump said that if Canada would become the 51st-aid citizens would have 60 percent less taxes to pay. But at the same time, what he didn't tweet on was more important. The Russians hit Ukraine hard on Christmas Day, trying to take down its energy infrastructure and make it a very cold winter, and really trying to set up the leverage for negotiations. And that's the point you were making. Donald Trump is entering a much more dangerous world than in his first term. And I think a lot of these tweets are distractions and the real challenges are to come. I almost see them, Fred, as hints of what the next phase of U.S. strategic engagement is going to look like. So when we read Greenland, which is something that had come up during his first term, I mean, you have to think, you know, shipping lanes, energy, right? Russia, when you think Panama, you think, again, transporting, perhaps energy shipments, other kinds of goods, you know, a key route for that. Canada, what do they have in abundance? Energy supplies, right? I mean, I look at this, and I think to myself, the essential thing that is going to happen in the next few years is trying to figure out, are we or who is going to supply the world or are allies, at least, with cheap, abundant energy? You're up in particular. You know there are challenges better than anybody, Fred. And so is this meant to be a way of bolstering America's kind of energy reserves, its ability to supply the rest of the planet and kind of protect its territory? When there were reports of like, well, Russian subs off the coast of Florida not long ago? I mean, so there, I think these actually are telling us about the strategic challenges he faces. Well, Kelly, I think you're right. I spoke to a Middle Eastern leader right after Trump's election. I said, what's the impact going to be on the world? He said about $20 a barrel. And so, minus. So, minus. So, minus, jokingly, because of course the U.S. was going to drill, drill, drill and produce more energy. The real point is that Trump thinks about leverage. Be thinks about leverage in transactional terms and wear in a strategic situation. What's really different from his first term and the reason we're in a much dangerous, more dangerous situation is the axis of aggressors, China, Russia, North Korea, Iran. They are combining their forces in a defense industrial way more than autocrats ever. If you look at Mussolini Hitler, the Imperial Japan in the 1930s, they did not cooperate anywhere nearly as closely as these four countries are doing. Right. So, doesn't that Fred argue for the U.S. to at least be thinking about how to bolster ourselves in response? I mean, again, who else can we look to to kind of build out against Europe? Has massive economic problems right now, which are the result in many ways of the inability to have cheap energy. So, it's like you have to solve that problem. You have to get their growth back up to speed. You have to get them to say, I mean, we're kind of like out here doing it alone. Well, and the problem is many people think that that's fine and it's not. So, to have Germany down to zero growth or less, you have elections in Germany early in the year. You have Macron and France, he's in political trouble. You know, you have political, political weakness, economic weakness. Wherever you look in Europe, but if you actually want to stand up to China, you need a strong Europe that's going to be willing to put leverage on China together with you or you're not going to have the leverage you need. Same with Russia and same in the Middle East as well. And so, it may look short-term, you know, their week. And we're strong and isn't that good. But if we've got 3.5, 4-point growth and they've got 1-point growth or less, and you extrapolate that over 10 years, we are going to have a very weak Europe and a weaker partner to work with us on the world stage. I think back in 1990, you know, our GDP per capita was only 15 percent higher than Europe's and now it's 30. And that trend is just going to keep goods probably, you know, accelerating the last couple of years. So, I guess my final point to be this, what do you think this all tells us about what Trump's international kind of initiatives are actually going to be? How do you counter the access that you are describing? Well, he's coming in with a lucky hand. Iran is as weak as it's been in 30 years. This air defenses are down. It's shown that it can't hit Israel with its own missiles. It's lost its proxies. So he's got some leverage with Iran. Russia may look strong because it's hitting Ukraine right now, but having lost Assad, it's a partner in Syria. And having lost its bases, its strength in Syria and some in Africa was well. You know, it's facing economic difficulty. It can lose its reserves in 2025. So Russia is also looking weak. I think the play is potentially with China because China will see if it continues to partner with Russia and with Iran, isn't that long-term smarter than dumb or even short-term dumb? And could Trump, if he were thinking more like Kissinger, unless it hit Trump, see this as a strategic opportunity to actually shift China from its current course? I think the stakes are big. This could be the biggest 2025 could be the biggest geopolitical year in our lifetimes, because so many things are moving. War in Europe, in the Middle East, tensions with China, a race for technological heights. Trump is coming in with a real strong hand. The question is, how is he going to play it? I don't think it's going to be through Greenland and Panama. We'll see. I still have to get used to saying 2025, not yet, but preparing myself. Fred, thank you very much. Really appreciate your time today. Not the holidays. You too, Fred Kemp with the Atlantic Council. Speaking of the energy market, it's been a brutal year for renewables. The ice share is clean energy ETF, having its worst performance in more than a decade. Pippa Stevens has been taking a look through. I don't want to call it the wreckage, Pippa. But what are you here in terms of what people think could happen now going into 2025? Yes, 2024 was a bad year, and honestly 2025 is not looking all that better with the overarching theme being one of caution. The primary culprit for this year's weakness is interest rates, which hit pre-revenue in capital intensive businesses, which many of these companies are especially hard. And depending on the new administration's policies, we could see rates stay higher for longer. While the full scale repeal of the inflation reduction act remains unlikely, given how much money has gone to red districts, projects will be delayed until there's clarity on that front. On the flip side, power prices are rising faster than overall inflation, which does bolster the case for solar. Plus, all these new data centers are going to require massive amounts of power, and given small modular reactors are a 2030 story, for the time being, wind and solar are the only emissions-free sources for tech companies with climate goals. Finally, grid-hardening is a theme that is here to stay. The increase in power demand couples with things like extreme weather means an infrastructure overhaul will be necessary. So Kelly, that's names like Maztech, Quanta Services, what are the picks and shovels of the energy transition? And meanwhile, my little obsession with what's going on with some of the old energy names, LNG in particular, oil. I mean, how do you think that people are lining up to capitalize on what could be some immediate change in the permitting, for instance, kind of have a lot more exporting going on from the U.S.? It seems like LNG is definitely one of the places where there could be an immediate, lethal moving type policy from President-elect Trump. And of course, we had that study from the DOE a couple of weeks ago on the impacts of LNG. But that feels like that's more the end of the Biden administration's look at the sector and when Trump takes office, he could restart that permitting process. And of course, you know, the U.S. is now the largest LNG exporter in the world. We took that place after first exporting in 2016. So it was a very fast rise. So in eight years, is that when we first started exporting, we say years ago? Yeah, we first started now. And now we're number one. That's right. It's going to be important, but then we had the Shaila Revolution. We had to turn them around. Yeah. And so now we surpassed Qatar and Australia last year in 2023 to become the World's Archers' exporter. And so now there is kind of, you know, limitless appetite, if you will, for that. Also look at Europe right now. I know you're just talking about this with Fred. That they're having a colder than expected start to winter. And so they are drawing down on that inventory faster than expected, which means that the outlook for next summer is very bullish for Nat Gas. And so that is one area where we could see executives more willing to, you know, open the taps as it were, not so much on the oil side. Yeah. But if you apply the drill, baby drill to Nat Gas, that could happen. Super interesting. Pippa, as always, thanks. Pippa Stevens. As we had to break, we continue to monitor Apple's road to a $4 trillion market cap. The magic number the shares have to hit is $264 in change. We're about $8 shy right now. That puts the current market cap. It's still a 3.912, which is just incredible. Speaking of tech, AI was all the rage this year. And Goldman is out with its predictions for how companies will use it in 2025. We'll dig into that list after this. This is the exchange on CNBC. Get a head start on 2025 with CNBC's big January, the hottest tech event, CES from Las Vegas, the data, the jobs report, and meet the future of biotech and pharma at JPM Healthcare. Check out the MX Golf Tournament from California, inauguration day, and the meeting of world leaders in Davos. Plus, the first Fed decision of the year, the investing edge you need to start the year ahead of the game, CNBC. It has been an incredible year for AI. I mean, every day I'm turning, we're messing around with the new products, the Gemini, the Notebook LM. You know you can talk to the podcast now. Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself. Nearly all the major tech giants are getting in the race and showing off impressive technical advancements. But what happens in 2025? That's the focus of today's tech check with Kate Rooney, who is here on set. Welcome. Great to see you, Kelly. Do tell. There's been so much to talk about. You guys, you said huge year. And that's one of the big questions. Candace, continue. The bar is certainly high, Kelly. Heading into next year, I spoke to Goldman's chief information officer about this. Marco, our gentie exclusively on the topic. He spent the bulk of his career at Amazon Web Services and Nokia back in the mobile era. We did talk about this year first. All of these advancements, he said right now AI feels like the emergence of cloud when he was at Amazon, but a lot faster. Biggest surprise this year was this technology moving beyond things like chatbots into this multimodal era where essentially AI that generates images and videos says next year, Fortune 500 companies will start to deploy AI in a much more impactful way. The first round of returns is going to be on really making the company more efficient and really making companies really like see some real bottom line benefits from the use of AI. This bottom line benefits, that's really what Wall Street wants to hear at this point. Better margins, more productivity, that would all be key to the AI. In the case, our gentie also says AI will result in what he called a new hybrid workforce. So AI agents working closely alongside people says there will also be the emergence of AI experts. So very niche, very specific industry knowledge, think of banking. For example, he is expecting major robotics breakthroughs, says AI safety is also going to become a bigger priority for company boards, not just regulators and then large language models. He expects that to be commoditized. He said, he put it this way, Kelly. We'll see many cars fewer engines. And engines really begin the underlying tech here. Yeah, and it's interesting to hear now all of the stuff about how was it open AI's model stall now because they ran out of data and they're trying to use synthetic, but I don't trust any of this synthetic data. Yes. So all of these questions about whether these big, big models are at the forefront or some of these more targeted things. But I love what you said to about how the, it's going to become a hybrid workforce. Half people and half AI. And HR manages for AI. He did bring that up. He said there's going to be people that are in charge of managing the AI, giving them feedback, maybe, interesting. Firing the AI. But I think the data conversation is so important. And he actually used this metaphor that I love. You think about the way AI has been trained right now with data. It's like there's a kid who grew up in a library and has read every book in the world's biggest library, but they've never been outside. So going forward, some of the data that's probably even more valuable is, he talked about things like temperature data and more visual data. So these things are going to get smarter as they're actually able to move beyond just text and kind of books. I hope so, because it will be more interesting if they do. We asked it yesterday something about where we were like mathematically, like, a husband will show me this. That, you know, let's say, you know, something that's gone up 50% in 10 years, but it actually works out to less than 4%. Anyway, it's a whole compound interest thing. So we asked, I think it was, we were doing the open AI chat. And it gave us the full formula, you know, compound interest, the whole thing. It was, it knew exactly what we were talking about and not just kind of approximated it or made something up. And that was revealing, especially because math wasn't a strong point when these were first launched. And some of the emerging is better at math, better at language and creativity. And anthropic is actually one that folks kind of point to, I have a friend who's a math tutor and said, oh no, like this one's much better at math. This one's really, so you are seeing a little bit of a different path. The anthropic one is that pro, no, cloud. Thank you. But that's really emerging as sort of the enterprise version. You haven't tried Santa mode. That was one of the things that came out in shipness. What's the real chat mode? What's the real chat mode? Chatch eBT has Santa mode. So there's a lot of these gimmicks, but they came out in the last couple of weeks. And you can change the voice to be Santa Claus. So it will give you this compound interest equation. It will be Santa's voice. It will be Santa's voice. That's what I was missing from my life yesterday. Thank you. Appreciate it. I always Kate Rudy in the house. Still ahead, America's housing market stagnated this year with rates on the 30-year mortgage stubbornly around 7% and affordability at rock bottom. That could have big implications for commercial real estate next year. We'll connect those dots for you and get a view from the sea suite of a luxury developer, the exchange. Bye.

But what's interesting is it's not an ant or thing with iPhones. iPhones are really popular too. It was a great, great holiday season for Apple from what I'm seeing. iPads, iPhones, the little like smart pen. Really, really interesting. I do love the stylus, although I just can never find it. There are some smaller items, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, by the way, um, but talk us through even just like the little food trends, jewelry, like what were you seeing there? Yeah. I mean, one interesting thing is the, the hair gadget is super, super big. I mean, we're talking 500, $600 gadgets here. Shark. It was a very big season for shark. Um, Ninja Creamies, which is a little machine that turns anything into ice cream. It's expensive, but anything's right. Ice cream, right? And then, you know, lots of, lots of, uh, there's lots of little gold bracelets. Gold seems to have overtaken silver. And in favor, um, and fancy lip glosses, even this one specific brand of hand sanitizer has emerged as a status item among teens. The brand is touch land. Okay. Because you know I go back after this and I go, okay, who, who is it private? Or it's a publicly held. It's a division of so and so. Maybe I should have gotten the, the turn any, turn anything into ice cream. It's basically just like cold mush. I mean, if you're, if it's a muffin and you turn it into ice cream, it's just a cold mushy muffin, right? Yeah. But that brand is, is Ninja. So it's part of the shark ninja. Yeah, it's, it's between the shark erapp and the ninja creamy of very, very big year for shark ninja. Anything else on the apparel for a dimension, Casey? Oh my gosh, Kelly, Lula lemon. It's still just dominating. Really? It's like a, uh, dominating her business list. Yes. So Lula and we're showing the shares. Um, it's kind of a weird year. It's been the end of athlete's year, long live athlete's year. What's driven this sudden, you know, ascendance in the past couple of months? And is it sustainable? Games and young women generally are wearing matching sets to work out, but not just to work out, even to run errands. So it's all about the like matching little bra tops and leggings, a lot of sweatshirts. I mean, even though athletes are itself has, has gone down a little bit, just comfy clothes in general or what kids are wearing to school these days, college high school middle school all of it. That is definitely true. Can confirm from a look at the matching outfits trend. I love it. Casey, as always, thank you, uh, bringing the inside. Thank you so much. Thank you. Next guest covers footwear in a peril and one of the names he's been on for 2025 was our mystery chart today. I WC and Tom Brune guessed it. Birkenstock, up 20% in the past month. He also likes boot barn decars and sketches. Let's bring in Sam Pozer. Sam, how are you? Welcome. Well, how are you? Happy holidays. You too. So kind of building off of what Casey just talked about, where do you see, um, sort of accelerating demand and good implications for this stocks? I mean, I just think that, you know, as I, as I've written and people have said, you know, I don't think people are shopping anymore. I think people are buying with intent. And that just limits, you know, the brands and specifically what they want. They go in there knowing exactly what they want and when they want it. So you have big winners and then brands and retailers not doing as well. And, and these, um, the companies that I like here are ones that I think are exactly are well positioned now and continue to be very well positioned for 25. Sure. And before I dive into that, I just want to, you did say something interesting and you're sounding somewhat cautious on overall spending, which again, if the mastercard data tell us that spending was only at 4% from last year, that's usually nominal, right? So if inflation is still at two and a half or three and you want 4% in real, then they should be telling us it grew 7%. Right? I feel like this is a little bit of a disappointing outcome. Well, I, I just think it's very specific. I think people have money, but you better have exactly what they want when they want it. And if you don't, you lose. So if, if there's, you know, if, if people are out there at places, they don't want it. They're not going to spend money if they don't want the stuff and, and your, the prior guest was mentioning some very specific brands and items that people want. Uh, you probably take another lip gloss or whatever that other was and they don't want all the other ones. They want that specific brand. So if they can't find it, they don't buy it. And again, it's just, it's a lot of intention here. And that's where Birkenstock, uh, Decker's and sketchers and boot barn come in. I think, you know, that they're, they know their customers exceptionally well and, um, they're executing against that exceptionally well. Do you have any, so you buy them now that a lot of the, them have had good years. You want to own them into the, the Trump tariff, uh, sort of whatever's coming down the pike there? Well, I mean, the Trump tariff is sort of an unknown. I mean, I would say that if I look at my coverage right now, I, I mean, I had a, just Trump tariff specifically, I, I look at sketchers probably being the best position given that they're doing over 60% of their business outside the United States. Um, they do have a lot of production still in China, but, um, they also have one of the best supply chains in the marketplace. So that's a big, that's a, you know, that's just sort of a good position to be in, not to say, you know, that's just tariffs specifically. Um, I think they, they're very well positioned to manage that. Um, but again, if you have products that people want, you have the ability to raise price as long as you continue to innovate and as long as you stay in front of those customers properly, um, they'll still be with you as long as there's a value. When value doesn't necessarily mean price, it's value. Yeah. And, uh, Sam is always, it's good to check in with you. Appreciate your time today talking us through it. Hey, thanks. Happy to hear you too. Sam Pozer Williams trading coming up shares of a Sarah labs are climbing 4% today to an old time high. A lab is up more than 300% now from its IPO price of 36 and about 180 from its opening price of 52 back on March 20th. Uh, an IPO that has been one of many this year. It's actually put up pretty decent performance. We'll see if next year brings a flood more or not the exchange will be right back. Welcome back to the exchange. We're seeing slight negatives. I mean, literally two four 10 points across the board. Now the Russell 2000 small caps are up by 11. Remember, this should be us in the midst of the Santa Claus rally as Bob outlined top of the hour. 1% gain the last five trading days of this year. First couple of next years, often what we get we've already gotten 1% gain, by the way. Um, so now if we take a pause today, not that unusual 10 year treasury was above 460, maybe putting some pressure on stocks, but it's back below that. Maybe everyone's feeling more dovish after hearing from Dave Zervos earlier this hour. And some of the movers were watching include Toyota today, whose shares are surging 8% on a Nique report that the company plans to double its return on equity. It's ROE target to 20%. Of course, its global sales were flat in November and Toyota has seen production drop for 10 straight months. Still, it's now up 12% in a week. And Starbucks is popping about 2% despite barista strikes expanding to more than 300 stores across 45 states this week. The workers in their union seeking an immediate hourly wage increase about up to 64 percent, which the company called quote, not sustainable. Starbucks shares again up about 2 and a quarter. And finally, Bitcoin is down today. About 3%, but it's back below 96,000 and it's now 11% below its record high, which was just under 109,000. And that was said a few weeks ago, it's slide causing a hangover effect across the crypto space, micro strategy and coin base are both also in the red today. Coming up real estate, one of the worst performing sectors this year. It's up about 2% since Jan one, but the best performing names have actually seen some really nice gains. Iron Mountain taking top spot climbing more than 50%. CBRE, well tower digital real estate trust, Simon property, round out the top five. We'll get predictions from the C suite for the luxury real estate market next. Welcome back to the exchange commercial real estate services firm CBRE, expecting 2025 to be a big year for the industry, saying while retail and data centers have been good supported by longer term growth trends, all the other sectors will see the start of a new cycle firm says while economic growth will support more household formation, the high cost of home ownership will still drive multifamily vacancies down. Good news for my next guest, his company just opened three multifamily developments this year in Miami or Lando and Atlanta and is set to open one in Brooklyn next year here to discuss his 2025 predictions as Kevin Maloney. He's the CEO of PMG. Kevin, it's great to see you. Welcome back. Thank you. Thanks for having me. Just tell us kind of what you expect off the cuff going into next year. Well, we think it was a multifamily's been a little down rates are up costs were up. A lot of multifamily is oversupplied the marketplace currently. But on the other side of the coin that brings great opportunity to buy to lend into those programs. But for us, we're going to probably suffer the same consequences of a lot of the other builders and developers have suffered over the country around the country is multifamily is oversupplied and needs to be absorbed. So I think the multi business for the next year or so is going to be relatively soft. Right. And while I don't want to cheer for you to struggle from an inflation point of view, I'm thrilled. I want to throw a party and say, great, Renser are moderating and that's going to bring inflation down and maybe the Fed can react and it's been the biggest area where things have been sticky, right? It absolutely has and you're 100% spot on. So hopefully that was we've had three, three reductions in rates this year, probably about 120 bips. It really hasn't affected cap rates exit cap rates yet. You know, on the leasing side and the income side we're seeing as much as three month concessions. So there's no question that there's going to be a downturn in the multifamily business. But again, you know, smart buyers today, you know, are going to buy class a multi relatively inexpensive. They're going to sit and watch supply continue to do window. And you're going to see some shifting in rents again. And hopefully with some some some action by the Fed over the next two to three years, you're going to have a really winning formula. Yeah, it could be a win for everybody. You see the most opportunity right now in South Florida, also Florida's West Coast, Florida, Florida in Denver and in Nashville. Some of these markets people were concerned about a little bit of frothingness in years past. What do you see? No, there's still is. Nashville clearly is over supplied right now, but Nashville also has great economics in terms of employment growth. A lot of companies are a tax advantage state and Nashville is the center of that state. So we think on the long term, Nashville is a great bet. In Denver, we really are not going to be building and starting into the multi that we have sites approved for. But we are building luxury condominium in Denver, which is a new thing for us. And that's doing quite well for us. Atlanta also is a bit over supplied, a great market to be buying in currently for a long term play, but looking at it from a 12 month point of view, it's going to be soft. By the way, how do you define luxury when you're, is it a rent threshold or in a amenities type of thing? It's all of those things. So it's really amenity driven. It's it's a part and layout driven. It's it's packages within the apartments and that really drives rents. I mean, for us, we are always looking for the top of the market, the highest rents in the marketplace. We have to overmanitize the buildings. We have to deliver product that's far and above what would be considered typical class A apartment. And where else do you think you're going to be able to capture the highest rents in the marketplace in the next couple of years? Well, Miami is still a pretty hot market. We're about to launch and which I think is one of the few multifamilies to get out of the ground this year, honestly nationwide. We're about to launch a 550 unit rental on brick. And downtown Miami, that market is still relatively robust. And strong. So we're bullish there. And again, we're looking for opportunities on the buy side over the next year because we think, you know, we were going to try and take advantage of the softness. Sure. Take advantage of those. The stress in are the banks, the willing partner and that are as this private credit. How is it funded? It's mostly private credit from our point of view. The banks are unless you listen, unless you've eroded value all the way down through into the debt, the banks really wouldn't be involved. It would be a purchase and a refinance. Or be an investment into the vehicle with some sort of hope, net note for the current developer. All that, those strategies are being laid out currently in the marketplace. What do you make of this trend where restaurants like Carbone become kind of property developers of major towers? Listen, branding is is a big business today. And oh, it's a today. It's been around for a decade, but branding is becoming more and more important and everyone's jumping into the business. Typically, it was hotel brands that were doing really well. We're building, as you said, a couple or a few walled orfs around the country right now. They're very successful. But lately, you've had like Dolce Cabana jump in and you've had car companies jump in and now restaurants are jumping in. So, you know, it's, you know, trying to figure out who your consumer and your buyer is and then figure out what brand works and what marketplace. That's really the goal. So it wasn't all the best of them if they can make it work. Yeah. And finally, how were you able to get stuff, you know, literally off the ground with rates where they are this year? So again, in the multi business, we're really stalled. We're not going to be really other than the one in Brickle, which is a combination.
