 CNBC exclusive Avenue Capitol CEO Mark Lazry, his 2025 market outlook. Where is he putting his money now and investing in sports? Stay ahead of the market. Squawk box tomorrow, 6am Eastern CNBC. My mission is simple to make you money. I'm here to level the playing field for all investors. There's always a low market somewhere and I promise to help you find it. Man money starts now. Hey, I'm Kramer. Welcome to Man Money. Welcome to Kramer, America. Of GoonRake Friends, I'm just trying to make you a little money. Now my job is not just to entertain, but to teach you. And that's what we're doing tonight. So call me at 1-800-743-CNBC or tweet me at Jim Kramer. Yes, tonight I'm letting you in on something big. The method to my man. I believe that you can do everything I do at home. But you're willing to put in the time and effort. Investing, simply investing in individual stocks, running your own portfolio rather than dumping your money in some buy it and forget index fund is something I am confident all you can do by yourself. I always emphasize the homework and I hope you do the homework for my travel trust stocks if you join the CMC Investing Club. In the old days, remember, wasn't you need one hour per week per stock? These days though, the research is so readily available online that I'm going to account this less than an hour a week for portfolio five stocks. Say a few hours if you own 10 stocks unless you belong to the club itself and you have too much easier time and you cut down how much well homework you have to do is be doing with you. Investing is more than just 10 stocks and then I get worried because that can be difficult unless you're managing money full time. Of course, if you don't have the time, more the inclination to big stocks, then you won't better off parking your money in a low-cost index fund that mirrors the SB 500. And I like those. They're good. I'm in some but if you're willing to put in the work, regular people can trance the averages as long as you're disciplined and you follow the rules, rules be constantly highlighted as part of the CMC Investing Club. How do you store? Well, that's what we're talking about tonight. Like I said, the show is all about the method or methods to break from strictly quoting the bar to my madness. How do I pick stocks? What gets on the show? How do I tell you some stocks are worth buying and dipped in some art? Those are the questions that people constantly ask me. Tonight you're going to get a piece of the answers. The truth is that I've got far too many methods, far too many ways of picking out great stocks to ever cover all in one show. But I want to give you some of the tools of my trade, enough so that you can start to pick stocks like me on your own. Remember, I want you to be a manager, a great manager of your own money, because you can focus on a smaller number of names. Well, I have to fall practically everything. Pick it for the lighting around. If you end the day this show is about educating you, giving you the ultimate insider's perspective on how the market works, and how it can help you try to make money. Not here, just to dull out stock picks like the proverbial fish you give a man, if you're two-aids and teach them to shop for fish at a whole foods. What I really like to do is empower you. And that starts with me teaching you all the many tricks I use to pick out great stocks and invest to the micro pro methods that have served me well for more than four decades. And that allowed me to generate a 24% annual return after fees for 14 years of my old hedge fund. Not bad, because better than market. These skills are what refresh this show and guide me as I manage my own travel trust now. I'll learn the exercise that you can follow, of course, by joining the club. Now, let's get rolling. One of the easiest ways to identify potential cramer names, the stocks that could possibly, I should possibly own, but not necessarily end up on the show, is by watching a list that comes out every day. It's called the New High List. Stocks in that illustrious list, the highest of the high. Obviously, it's something going for them, and that's especially true when the markets in bad shape. As only the best of the best can hit new highs when the averages are falling apart. So what does it tell you when a stocks win the New High List? Either that is part of a broader bull market because it's sectors on fire, or the company itself has some serious earnings or sales momentum. No matter how they get there, many stocks in the New High List often keep going higher, because it's kind of a list of A students that are worth betting on. They tend to keep getting straight A's on every quarter, just like the real smart kids in school. In a great bull market, we see this over and over and over again. The same stocks would hit New High after New High after New High, and following them was a difficult way to make money, even as the bears claimed endlessly that the bull market was false and couldn't be trusted. What's the thing that bears has pushed you to miss out on some of the greatest rallies in history? Of course, I'm not saying you can just chase any stock that's hitting New Highs, because they'll keep going higher. That would be the ultimate and foolishness, true boasts of the clown behavior. I am saying that if you want to identify potential winners, unless there's been a stunning sea change in the market caused by changing interest rates, possibly the political environment, then a good place to start. A wonderful place to start is the New High List, emphasis on start. That's the thing about the market. It's not always that hard to play once you understand that there's often more continuity than change. Things pretty much keep going the way they were going until something made your shifts, and then you have to order your course. Those courses, of course, changes, they can be pretty radical though, and that's why you always have to be reevaluating your ideas, and you should never dig in your heels when the facts change. Something I emphasize over and over again when I sit in out these investing club bullies. Now, I rarely recommend buying stocks straight off the New High List, unless there's some special circumstances that I'm going to talk about later tonight. What I like to do when I'm hunting for stocks, and what you should do is wait for something to pull back from the New High List, because that is the best place to start by the buy. You're buying. New High List is not a shoppiless, it's an inspiration list. You keep an eye on those names, then wait for them to come down so that you can pull the trigger. The pullback, ideally, 5-gate percent. 5-gate percent gives you a good lower price entry point, and a stock that likely has a lot of positive going forward. The maybe has been pulled down by an overall move in the stock market. That's been the optimal level. I found less than 5 percent and you're probably too early, more than 8 percent. And it's more likely that something's going wrong, very wrong, maybe even with the underlying company. Pouring over the new high list is a fabulous way to identify potential. And I stress that we're potential stocks to buy. You only buy stocks that have pulled back from the new high list. If you're confident, they'll make a comeback for substantive reasons unrelated to the broader market. Unrelated to the broader market, but related to your stock. You need to do all the same homework you orderly do before buying a stock. You absolutely must have conviction. Even if it's a cynical conviction that the stock is going higher, that it deserves to go higher. And the biggest caveat of all when you're shopping for stocks that have pulled back from their highs, make sure they have them pulled back for a good reason. The sell-off needs to be extraneous to their business. Don't go buy in a homebitter and it's down because interest rates flew up, because the package didn't really hurt their numbers. But if a big pharmaceutical stock gets hurt by higher rates, there's nothing to do with their earnings, so maybe it's worth buying. Be certain you're dealing with a momentarily damaged stock and not a trouble company that's going down, down, down. How can you tell the difference between a damaged company damaged stock? The fundamentals haven't changed. The stock probably hasn't fallen through grace. It's pulled back from a category since poverty taking or some panic in the market in general. Now, more than ever, stocks are traded like commodities. By ultra leverage fund, head ultra levered hedge funds, frequently causing huge sell-offs that make no sense whatsoever. So you'll see high-quality stocks pull back off their highs for unrelated reasons to their core business. But if the fundamental picture changes and whatever made that stock attractive as it climbed its way up to the new high list goes away, then that stock is no longer a candidate for your portfolio. The story has to be intact with this method won't work. Here's the bottom line. That's the first method to pay for this man. Just watch for stocks that have pulled back from a pre-selected list, the new high list, especially because a broad market sell-off is sometimes an equate opportunity. Some of my best picks for the club have come out of the process, and hopefully some of yours can too. Let's take some calls. Let's go to Andrew in Georgia. Andrew. Hey, Mr. Kramer, how's it going today? Ah, good day. How are you, Andrew? I'm doing well. Thank you for asking. I'm very, very new investor. I've only been investing for about 30 years. One, I just want to say I appreciate everything you do for the new guys, which don't really know what they're doing. Thank you. Thank you, Andrew. That's terrific. How can I help you? My question is about earnings and not-to-yos. I want to know, after the earnings analysis, how long should it be great? Like when you say smoke clear and when it comes to the ideal of the same thing and when it comes to the top of the flat. Okay, so you know, I find that after an IPO, you really have to be very careful because what you've got are a lot of analysts who kind of want to say positive things and they tend to lose their critical faculties. My advice is very clear that when you get a stock that's down substantially from where it opened, that's how you look at it because a lot of times the OPs control by people who are just way too enthusiastic. A company with actual earnings and a good balance sheet that trades at a premium to the stock market but has a premium growth rate, that might be okay. But otherwise, no thank you. I'll find better stocks. How about Dreda in West Virginia? Dreda. Well, good evening. Good evening. Thank you, first of all, for everything that you do. I think you're a national treasure. I have so much from listening to your show. You're very kind. Thank you. Oh, when you want to generate cash, how do you decide what stocks to sell? Okay, we talk about this a lot in the club and I tend to rate my stocks one to four about following their fundamentals, always willing to sell a four or even a three on any live. What I try to look at is I look at like paintings. I'm like trading collection. I don't want to buy a new painting without selling an old painting. I want to have a museum. And what I look for are companies that reported a bad quarter, okay, that was disappointing to me, that have a little bit of lift that I can start lightning up from because I don't want to sell a company that just reported good quarter. I'm looking for companies that disappoint. They're already always there and you have to have the discipline to sell sell sell sell. As hard as it might be. Timothy in New York, Timothy. Yeah, hi, Mr. Cameron. Thanks for taking my question. I want your opinion on quants. My understanding of quants is that they screen dozens of parameters on thousands of stocks and use algorithms to rank them in terms of valuation, growth, momentum, profitability, revisions and so on. Outcomes are graded, buy, hold or sell recommendation. Don't want portfolios have a very good, except a repeatable performance. It seems to me that at a bare minimum, these are a valuable tool. On the other end, why wouldn't an investor use them exclusively? That's a great question. Look, I think that a lot of times the quants go up and down, trade too much. They recommend stocks and then the charts says no or the numbers say no. I like to buy great companies with great management that have good secular tailwinds behind them. And the quants don't necessarily catch those, but I do think that everything, whether it be quants, whether it be charts, whether it be everything that is from research. I like to include it all. And if some quants have some great records and they share us with what they share us data that they're using, I'm a buyer too. Okay, so now you know the first method of framers man is what first stocks that are pulled back from that pre-selected list of good companies called the new Highless is best because of a broad market sell, but not because of something having to add company itself. Some of my best picks have come out of this process, hoping some of you years can too. All man tonight, I'm giving you an in depth look at many more methods.

Where is he putting his money now and investing in sports? Stay ahead of the market. Squawk box tomorrow, 6am Eastern, CNBC. Welcome back to tonight's Methods Demand in Special. Where I'm revealing some of my best tricks for buy and selling stocks. Trying to give you the real sure ones. You got a truly title of some besting wisdom for the ages, but I'm too humble to say that. If my earnings were older, I tell you to think of me as the pen and teller of the stock market. With a physique that's a whole lot more like teller than pen. I want to pull back to Curtin to show you how a professional looks for stocks to buy and knows what to sell. There's no magic. There's no hidden talent. Just a bunch of disciplines. This one's that can help you try to make mad money if you master them. You're not being genius. You don't even have to be all that smart to be completely honest. You just need to know what to heck. You're doing and putting some homework. And that's where Kramer of the Sabbath wise clown comes in. Maybe less of a sad clown these days and more like the fool from King Lear. Something to think about. Enough Shakespeare. Let's move on to more important things like how to find stocks that are great buys. Now earlier I was talking about picking up all of some stocks that have pulled back from the new high list because you get a cheaper entry point. Something that's already been approved I said you rarely want to buy names right off the new high list because you're paying too much for them. You usually get a better chance, a better deal if you're patient and wait for some, wait, there's you know 5-day percent. Given how volatile the market can be even when things are going well there are very few occasions when buying a stock right off the new high list can be justified. Have some patience. But sometimes the stock is so hot that you got to buy it even wherever you can. As soon as you can because it's not heading lower anytime soon. I've felt that and you felt it. You won't find these often but when you find them you have to remember not to buy all at once. You want to buy a hundred shares of a stock and you think it's got so much mojo that it won't get a pull back from the high. Hey how about this by 25 shares. Words that happens it goes higher still and you don't get to buy more so you grab a quick profit and find the next one. Believe me there is always another one coming down the pipe. No I got one exception where it's okay to buy stock that's hitting a new high. If you see insiders buying the stock when it's already up a great deal that's a total green light don't laugh it does happen it's rare but it does happen in my experience it's rare still a dismethor of pinky stocks doesn't work out. I love it when I see insiders buying it for you some run that is the terrific side of the confidence that the insiders have that the rally made just beginning or that there's a big runway ahead and they sure think it's going to be a long lasting FYI insiders can flip a stock that they buy immediately that way at least six months otherwise the government takes away the games that's the law so these people are seeing positive things that likely aren't going to disappear in six months time. Boy do I like that. Normally insiders buying ranges from meaningless to a small but yeah it's well better on its own insufficient reason to buy a stock. Sometimes you catch insiders buying their stock because they want to give the impression of confidence creating a illusion that they're doing better than they really are insiders aren't stupid they notice they get to seem buying their own stock even small amounts and the market will smile upon them so occasionally they game the system that's fair but it means we ignore most insiders buying that is not substantial because it could be pure flim plan. That's that when you get truly colossal insiders buying even if it's not all at at the high but you're then you might want to take another look at the stock question when the insiders buy a whole lot of shares what a powerful endorsement. Crucially if the volume of the insiders buying that it really does declare it's sincerity but we're only focusing on one sort of insider buying right now the kind you see in stocks that have been running and aren't perceived as being historically cheap or low dollar marketplace those sometimes can be down there for a reason. See there's nothing more arrogant and yet telling then when an insider backs up the truck for their own stock when it's been rolling along at a good clip think about it what they're saying is yeah we know we rock our stock has been in flago and we're so darn confident it'll keep going higher that we're going to buy shares right now hand over fest. Erick it sure but this is it's rare but it is bankable youbres corporate insiders aren't foolable some notable exceptions like probably they may have money won't change plus if their stocks are already on the tear there's probably a good chance the executives know what they're doing. Of course not everyone deserves the benefit for the doubt in this business and if your so many investors got burned by the 2021 boom in Ipeos and SPACS I know that a lot of people assume most CEOs and execs are really a bunch of liars for all its crooks mouth backs but look that's the wrong lesson to draw from the IPO approach healthy skepticism one thing a total unwillingness to believe anything positive is something else entirely if you're going to invest in the stock market you need to be willing to extend some measure of trust to the people who run the companies that you own shares and otherwise why bother just go buy the index fund what else could be going on disperns that are buying even when the FTC and the Justice Department and the trust division are hostile to mergers you still get some takeovers sometimes executives will buy their own stock because they hear footsteps of a potential acquire they've been told by bankers is a lot of companies interested in them without anything specific maybe they've been contacted by companies and they turn those companies down spurned overtures happen all the time and if executives expect that they they may be next well it's a it's a healthy and honest reason to buy or maybe they realize that the businesses indeed worth more than they thought and can be broken up do I bring out some value all different generations of scene about outtreated tyco even two-pont we've seen tons of these breakups over the years and they genuinely produced long-term gains because Wall Street likes smaller more straight for companies that are easier to get your head around think up think about think about about carrier about odys about the old united technologies maybe the executive senior ability to create value and they want it on themselves or maybe the stocks run just a bit but they don't think the runners over because they recognize how much better the business will be once it's broken up for me buying after big rally can certainly feel a little reckless and even lazy most investors are smart enough to wait for a pullback for the pullback trigger but insider buying after decent run tells me that one of the people who knows the business best doesn't believe there will be a pullback and there's nothing more bullish than that sure I feel you want to wait until the stock sells off after the insiders have bought but that's the best of all possible worlds it doesn't happen all that often I've seen it happen in some red hot text stocks that cool up very momentarily and that's a terrific sign to buy bottom line one more method of cramers man is when you see insider buy in a stock that has already had a solid run in middly arrearity you might want to do some buying too then money's back after the break coming up need another tool in your belt to help identify the right time to buy a stock cramers revealing how short interest in a name could be your telltale sign to buy it next it's CNBC's big January with CES from Las Vegas biotech and pharma at JPM health care the world economic forum in Davos and the first fed decision of the year start the year ahead of the game CNBC in a great mood a man like boot even which is me at my best because well let's just say I'm pretty darn productive impression when I'm in high year I'm so revved up that I'm revealing many of my secrets the methods to my madness better to give you stockpays I'm giving some of the best ways I know to pick stocks I'm teaching invest in trade like cramers if not to be like me because I have some emotional issues that frankly you probably would prefer not to emulate someone off track so far I get into a way to buy precious secrets two of the tools that I use at my hedge fund and still use my travel trust which of course you can follow by joining the CBC investing club where unlike lady Gaga I play with an open hand not a poker face allowing subscribers to see all my trades before they happen what on T-Shoot tonight are really what I call telltale there are signals that a stock might be worth owning that it's worth your time in effort to go through the often boring process of reading through the conference called transcripts and quarterly filings to do the necessary homework there are thousands of stocks out there and any method we can use to narrow down the ones that might be attractive to us is a method worth having I've talked about it in center buying you're the hot and why I don't usually use this at a buy is the only way to determine whether or not a stock is cutting going there's one other scenario where inside a buy makes for incredibly bullish tell and that's when a stock has a heavy short position many a lot of people out there are borrowed shares sold those shares and are now waiting for those shares to go lower before they buy back the stock return them to the bank they borrowed them from and collect the difference between the price they sold them at first and the price they bought the stock back later you can think of shortings like regular investing only in reverse we try to buy low and sell high right it means that what we do shorts is turn it around they try to sell high and then buy low when a stock has a high short position that means a lot of smart people have serious conviction that the stocks hit it lower in fact it takes more conviction to short stop than does to go long because when you're short the potential downside is infinite when you're long a stock stops losing money when it hits zero shorts lose money when stocks go higher and there's no little one right the other thing about short sales is that if there's a lot of them then a stock all of a sudden gets some great news we get what's called a short squeeze and it sounds exactly like what it is in order to close out the positions the shorts have to buy this is called covering short covering when a lot of shorts covered the same time in a panic the stock will surge because what you really have is a lot of people desperate to buy the stock to cut down their losses a lot of demand they have to buy unless they want to perform a speed wiped out this process is so predictable that sometimes concerted buyers will foe men a short squeeze hey listen that's what game stop was all about that's what amc was all about that's what the meme stocks were all about so where does insider buy fit in the short selling equation okay let's say you have a stock with a high short interest then some of the people who run the company start buying shares for themselves or maybe an outsider takes a more than 10% stake in the business and indicates it wants more it's almost like drawing a line the sand for the short saying our stock goes this low and no lower this is an explosive combination people and one that often leads to a short squeeze that sends the stocks much higher shorts are smart in fact they often tend to be smarter than regular long side investors but they usually don't know more about a business in the insiders who run it if a lot of people are shorting a stock and management starts buying it in sizeable amounts you start doing your homework right then right now really so usually it makes sense to decide with management then you can ride a higher and higher in true Jackie Wilson style higher up lifting me up as the shorts panic and push shares higher in their desperation to cover their positions cut their losses and move on similarly when a company with a heavily shorted stock announces a juggled the buyback better bigger than any previous one that's another line in the sand situation where management is contradicting the shorts companies often repurchase their own shares and while not all buybacks are more some of them are just outright waste of money a substantial new buyback in the face of the shorts is often a good reason to take the closer look now a note of cautioner you need to be very careful in dealing with a company that's in the cross hairs of the short sellers especially when people are nervous in the markets in bad shape know the landscape the shorts have the ability to wreck a stock even if the fundamentals the underlying business are fantastic these days stock owners no longer have the benefit of rules they used to slow down short selling and make it harder to create bear rates well I got started in this business it was much harder to bet against stocks but the SEC got into those rules under both democratic and republican administrations all they have creating more efficient markets without these protections where you can't smash the stock down the shorts can easily assassinate stocks today smash them down anytime something goes wrong we see it during the financial crisis back in 2008 oh my god that was such a horrible period and we saw a smaller version of that during the many banking crisis of 2023 for the shorts it was like shooting fish in a bowel so many regional banks traded like they're going backward but other than a few near wells like first republic they were fine of course in recent years the short sellers have found themselves targeted by bull raids facilitated by social media platforms so they have to be careful but only when the memes stock crowd goes up after them enforced you never know when that's going to surface these are highly unusual situations up you can still find great opportunities in stocks with the shorts have overreached and the insiders are buying but before going into one of the situations I have to warn you that the balance of power still favors the short sellers that means even if the short sellers are wrong about a company's prospects they can still demolish the stock especially if they mount highly visible campaigns against the stock and look many times the shorts are right the stock deserves to be slaughter just don't underestimate the amount of damage the shorts can do in the end the best protection against bear raids are stocks to pay good solid dividends because when you short a stock you have to pay those dividends to ever you borrow the stock from that's a terrific deterrent where you see a stock with a big dividends being attacked by shorts and yields go at higher that's often a terrific place to be especially when the insiders are snapping up stock too so maybe the bottom line here inside of buying plus heavy short interest can equal ranging bull by as long as you avoid situations where the shorts are determined to crush the stock at any cost let's go to Debbie in Colorado Debbie hey Jim my husband and I are proud members of the club we absolutely love being members it's so much fun thank you Jeff Marks out pissing on to Jeff Marks by my colleague that's fantastic my question for you today is I have a 31 year old son and he's finally starting to listen to me so I was wondering if you had some tips and tricks for us to get him involved in the market he's got a goodly some of money to spend and he's really excited about getting involved well that's fantastic if he has a science band I mean there's so much he can do I would first look at biotech which has got some amazing amazing situations by the way like Dan or her because that that serves the biotech companies I like vertex I think you should look at vertex that's a terrific company and you know let's just not forget you do want to have a diverse by portfolio it's okay to be able to take a locate something stock to you you and I both know like a honeywell is still really incredibly cheap that we have and then you know maybe you have a stock that's a bit of a flyer like like a foot locker so build a diverse by portfolio but emphasize the science that I think you'll be in good shape now we're going to go to Vincent in New York Vincent hey Kramer how I'm good Vincent how are you I'm well what advice would you give a 26 year old that's been day trading for about two years and is looking to you know do better and go as far with this as you can all right but let's look if your day trading it's a full time occupation so what you want to do is put some money in the Vanguard total return fund and put some money in the Vanguard S&P 500 fund and just keep putting money away every single month you know you if you have some good day trades you made a lot of money put take off some of that capital and put it in those Vanguard accounts that's the way I would suggest do it because I want you to have exposure to the broader market not just to the stocks you trade right look in most cases the stock with insider buying and heavy short interest equals buy as long as you can avoid situation where the shorts are determined to crush the stock the euro much more man money head I saw some tools in my belt that I want to share with you including my method of trading around a core position to stick around right there viewers know that this shows all about investing only socks for the long haul not really short term trading because it's much easier to be good investor than to be a good trader especially when you're doing it part-time however knowing how to trade makes you a better investor and trading around a core position is one of the most basic and useful disciplines out there especially markets that often get hit by wild swings and that's most markets in recent years so what does it mean to trade around a core position okay let's go through it step by step first you need a stock pick one that you like one that you got an opinion about one way you have a bias the stock you believe is headed higher over the long term well you're really searching for here is a great company with shares that might get tossed around by market volatility even as you believe they'll only go higher if you're patient now if you were just investing then you just have a position to stop buying gradual increments because we all know that buying all at once it's just pure arrogance and that the end by the way this whole process of buying it increments is something that we constantly showing you how to do if you belong to the CMBC investing club we just talk about trading around positions takes something like Nvidia that's a chipmaker with fantastic long term story because they make the most powerful saving conductors on earth that we need it for cutting edge applications like artificial intelligence i love the video for the long haul but it's got an insanely volatile stock now let's see you want to own a hundred shares of Nvidia over time then the way to set position would be by 25 shares four times over a period of weeks or even months and that's your core position as investor but let's see you want to trade something that's hard to do but also cheaper than this ever bit because home gamers can now fit in you can flip it in fill out and the no stock commissions now i wouldn't recommend pure trading something like Nvidia my stance is on it don't trade but trading amount of core position different story so let's go back you own the hundred shares of Nvidia and let's assume it's sitting at I don't know I have about about 50 or about five hundred dollars for the purpose of it go it's five hundred every time the stock jumps another five percent you could sell 25 shares a core of your position you shave a little off to bring in some profits so once Nvidia is five twenty five you don't seventy five shares keep scaling out the same way of selling the way up but don't ever sell the final twenty five because that is your core position then you wait until something happens to knock the stock back down as long as nothing's changed with the underlying thesis you use that week this is stock couple more Nvidia we've done this for the for the chat chat trust it's going to happen pretty often because since we're in a world where stocks can get crushed by all kinds of factors nothing to the fun metals that's what happens now as the stock comes down the original cost basis you buy it back in increments since we started with one hundred shares let's keep using increments the twenty five to buy it back every five point for percent decline you can go beyond one hundred shares if it comes down low enough to now this might be a small potatoes up five percent so twenty five shares down where you started by twenty five shares and repeat the process of the way back up but over time your profits will add up and that's what trading around a core positions all about now a lot of people think trading is incredibly exciting and it can be but if you're good at trading around a core position you should be pretty bored or you really do it as watching stock move and then trimming or adding your position accordingly consider the image of trading is something it's reckless in your responsible trading around a core position is really the height of prudent portfolio adjustment boring by the way is good in this business exciting say this for the stadium obviously you can scale these numbers depending on how big your position is but the best idea is avoid putting yourself in a spot where you have too much on the table in case the stock gets spotted down or too little on the table take advantage of any upside to come to a way trading around a core positions an important basic strategy that everyone can use even those of you who find a notion of trading totally important because it's less trading in more just a supplement to investing so here's the bottom line now you know the basics of how to trade around a core position yet another method to my madness one that allows you to generate lots of small gains that I am telling you will add up over time we have money is back it's in the right coming up cramers revealed his tools to the trade of buying a stock but what about selling them cramers breaking down how to get out of a stock at the right time when mad money returns I've got one more trick to teach you tonight one more method my madness this time I want to talk about selling how do you know when it's all out stock yes but all the time how do you get out before the party ends so that you're not one of the last people around to get stuck cleaning up the mess now this is a question these be answered because there's a lot of money to be made by only hot stocks with lots of momentum but when you play the momentum game you need to know when it's time to leave the table there are always naysayers and eventually the naysayers almost always proven right because sooner or later virtually all hot stocks employed mental but the hot stocks here remember everything at word in 2021 claps 22 that's what I'm talking about but the collapse usually occurs later rather than sooner and all the negative talking heads who kept you out of the momentum stocks for the recklessness disguises prudence actually cost you a great opportunity to make money people shy away from these stocks because they don't know where they're going to stop they don't know where they're going to top out it's understandable and I'd be afraid to buy them too if I didn't have a discipline that let me know when to get out lucky for you I do have one and you're about to learn it first when I'm talking about hot stocks I really mean hot speculative stocks stocks of companies up with fairly low market capitalizations usually these stocks begin with very little research covers from major Walls progress houses they often don't even have earnings they might not even have sales they would never be as by these for the child trust we're not talking about that these names can go up for a very long time they can catch fire and stay on fire for years when they have the wind at their back the kid of thinking out when interest is peak and it's time to sell it's not from the stock it's by watching the analyst coverage you have to use your own judgment here but a good rule of thumb is that once one of these hot stocks has at least a half dozen analysts covering it the run is going to peter out because the stocking question is becoming too well known it's the rare speculative winner that can keep getting will keep winning after it gets big you can find out how many guys are on a stock by looking it up online this isn't hard to find information this formula is work for me first as long as I can remember as far as I can tell it works because the number of analysts on a stock is a good gauge of how much awareness and interest there is in the name hot stocks get tapped out when there's nobody left to be attracted to them to go buy more when all the people be interested in buying have already bought they come out of nowhere tracking more and more attention more and more backers and eventually everyone who wants a piece of this stock has a piece of it already and that happens the runs over it's time to go home oh and if the meme stock guys get their hands on it take advantage of their enthusiasm to ring the register that's a great sign that you want out because they can only push a stock up so much before they run out of firepower of course there are other situations where speculative stocks go out of favor all at once regardless of how much attention to getting to 2021 we had a huge run in anything related to electrophiles think car makers battery plays charging stations same goes for enterprise software stocks now a lot of this was fueled by an easy money environment near zero interest rates there was a lot of liquidity kicking around back and it had to go somewhere which is why so many money losing companies had red hot stocks but then the federal reserve declared war on inflation i can November 2021 letting you know that the age of is near zero interest rates has come to an end at that point we knew that the speculative fourth was about to be drained out of the entire market because that's what always occur when they tighten rates now i very quickly told you we're in a new environment where anything speculative was toast and instead you want to own real companies that make things or do stuff out of profit now i know wasn't the most elegant way to phrase it but these names held up much better the speculative place they got obliterated in 2022 but putting aside the interest rates issue when the feds not tightening and it's safe to speculate you need to watch how many analysts are following these little speculative stocks to know when the run's going to end bottom line once a red hot speculative stock gets too much attention it means the rally is likely on its last legs because there are only so many people who are willing to buy these things and eventually the bulls they run out of firepower stick with Kramer. Good evening Mr Kramer thank you thank you for everything you do you've been such a wonderful source of information with your teachings i have to say thank you for all your advice and saving us from ourselves your advice let me quit a job that i hated i love you good uh thank you for everything you do thanks for making us money more importantly thanks from keeping us from losing money i always say we have some of the smartest viewers in television and i love taking your questions listening to your pitches and hearing what kramericans want to know about so joining me today just to do this is jeff marks portfolio director for cmbc invest in club we're answering some of your burning questions and your hashtag mad mentions jeff does a great job helping out with the trust trust you're not like dears doing some great analysis for mad money viewers and members of trust you're not a member already i mean what are you waiting for so let's start right now with tim and albana uh and i think it's really question because how do you decide whether to take profit rather than keep us stocked longer to receive capital gains tax treatment these are always hard issues because i think that you have to worry about that kind of thing with your accounting professional because what i care about is whether sox can go up or down and i believe that if sox can go down you should take it off the table even if you have a big it that's what matters to me of course you want to see qualified advice for something like that uh but for the chat will trust uh that uh you could follow along with at home we don't really play that the tax game too much because everything gets donated the gains right donated to charity uh at the end of the year yeah i mean look at i i think it's i've always felt from real money my first book about investing they never fear the taxman fear the losses all right next up we're taking a question from Russell who yes i always try to follow your advice to buy stocks and portions rather than all ones very good often these stocks never pull back enough to buy more i ended up with small positions in lots of different stocks make it hard to manage what would you recommend okay this is another one where uh this is a discipline that i came up with which says that it's a way to figure out whether you missed the move or not like if you come in and this stock keeps going on there's no doubt about it that you are late there's just nothing you can do if you don't get it all in i've accepted that consequence if i'm late then all i do is i have a small game that's just the way i look at it's a high quality problem to have um if you if you're able to continue to do the homework then you can still hold them especially if the prospects are quite good but yeah it's a it's a challenge because you don't want to spread yourself too thin with a whole different number of stocks uh but look if they're going higher um you know yeah it's not it's a it's a quality issue that we deal with sometimes it's just a point i mean you know what happens if you buy it all once and it goes down you know it's a good chance that could happen and we're trying to avoid that that's the real worry right now let's take a question from Randy and Ohio s i know that when bonds sell off the rate goes up if bonds do so off what why would it impact stocks okay there are many different ways you can answer this one is is that if interest rates go up for something that is risk-free a bond uh then that has greater appeal than a dividend which may be equal because the dividend well you know what that's the only part of the equation of what a stock returns and if the stock goes down big then you wipe out the whatever gain you get from the dividend and then of course there's long-term considerations as you know about uh just about the value of a bond versus stock further out right it's competition for dollars like you brought uh uh what you mentioned but uh interest rates are also used uh to in a in a discounted cash flow model where uh investors they look at the cash flows out they estimate them they discount them back and when the interest rates higher they get discounted discounted at a higher rate that lowers the present value that lowers the value of stocks uh but there's also uh things like financing costs if it's used uh if a company relies on financing uh to uh sell their their products higher rates might hurt their business as well you just have to just think stocks aren't as competitive in many different ways than bonds if rates go up I mean it's really that's the way you have to look at it even if you don't finally actually understand discounted cash flows you kind of have to take it for granted that that's what occurs next line in Virginia wants to know if I only have five shares or something remaining and you recommend taking some profits so I close out the position or let it ride these are just questions that are so hard because you know five shares reminds me of like the tail end of what we have some wind you know it's like a tail end and what do you do and the five shares is really so that if you if the stock goes down you can buy more uh so if the stock goes up and we recommend sell I would just get rid of it I really would I would just say let's move on and find something better uh because there's always something better no it's it's an absolutely a fair debate if they are growing the dividend growing profits the outlooks are bright maybe you could sell one or two but you also don't want to fall into that trap of from the earlier question that we just had about managing too many positions so there's always cross disciplines that happening right now and that's one of the things that people don't understand about investing is that there is no right to roll there's often two rights that compete against each other now I have a question from Kyle who asks do you have a similar approach to investing in index funds as you do stocks where you would wait until the oscillators very oversold or would you just dollar cost average in index funds now this is very funny because this is where I've got two disciplines what I like to do if I'm putting money in every month uh if there's a month that's down more than 10 percent I double and put like if like let's say August is down 10 percent I take July's contribution uh keep that August contribution and then I take uh September's contribution and I take the September and August together and I just feel like that's a good level so you might be let's say you have 112 112 112 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 well there you go well I mean look stocks generally should be more attractive as the prices come in right you want to run from a a sale at a department store but on the other hand what I would say if it's index funds it's more about time in the market than necessarily trying to time it oversold over bought um you just want to be invested right I just for the long term I and I think that that's a really important issue we do not buy my method try to imply that we're necessarily timing the market just trying to put a little more money in at that one level right but certainly do the rest when prices fall 12 yeah just what you should do yeah well what could I say I say there's always more market somewhere I probably try to find it just for you right here on me
