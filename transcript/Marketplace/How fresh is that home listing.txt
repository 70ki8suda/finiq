From American Public Media, this is Marketplace. In Washington, DC, I'm Kimberly Adams in for Kyra's All. It's Monday, December 30th. Good to have you along. The tightness and lack of affordability in the housing market has been one of the major economic stories of 2024. And to end the year in housing data, tomorrow, we'll get an update on home prices. Today, we got the latest numbers on home purchases in progress from the National Association of Realtors. Pending home sales grew for a fourth straight month, up 2.2% in November. And even though mortgage rates remains stubbornly high, we have seen some gains in housing inventory. Marketplace's Elizabeth Troval has more. In Orlando, Florida, Realtor Rose Camp says the housing market is finally balancing out and for buyers. For the first time in several years, there are options. She says, well, before you might have had to pick between one or two homes in a zip code now, you actually can probably go out and see, you know, five homes, let's say, that have the potential for you. In an Austin, Texas Realtor Kent Redding says there's also been an uptick in inventory. Anything's 2025 will be a good time to buy. Oufses are selling, new houses are going on the market and we're not seeing wild swings. That's a healthy market to be in. Though active listings are at the highest level since 2020, according to new analysis by Redven. It's not all good news. Redven economist, Shea Harry Arbha Hari says that's because many listings are stale inventory. Or a home has sat on the market for at least 60 days. He thinks houses are just sitting there largely because they're priced too high while buyers also factor in other costs like interest rates and insurance. You're just looking for affordability. And economist Lawrence Yoon with the National Association of Realtors says if you look at the market before 2020, we are beginning to see more choices, but compare to pre-COVID, right before COVID arrive to say 2019 or 2018. We are still short by about 30% fewer homes on the market. He says while inventories are trending the right direction, some homeowners locked into three or four percent interest rates are still staying put. I'm Elizabeth Troball, our marketplace. Wall Street today, stocks continued their year-end retreat. We'll have the details when we do the numbers. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ With the new year comes a raft of new policies kicking in, starting January 1st, seniors on Medicare will pay no more than $2,000 a year out of pocket for prescription drugs. That's down from this year's cap of $3,250. Now limiting how much Medicare recipients pay for prescription drugs is a relatively new federal policy. It came out of the 2022 inflation reduction act. Before the cap started phasing in this year, some seniors were paying tens of thousands of dollars a year out of pocket to cover their meds. Marketplaces Samantha Fields has more. The whole point of health insurance is to make medical care affordable, at least in theory. Insurance is supposed to be limiting big financial shocks. Benedict Ipollito at the American Enterprise Institute says if a health plan doesn't cap the amount you can be required to pay. It's not a particularly good insurance product. Private health plans have long had some kind of out-of-pocket maximum, but not Medicare. It was unusual in that it did not cap how much you could spend on, in this case, prescription drugs. There was no cap at all. Matthew Fiedler at the Brookings Institution says until this year, if you were taking a really expensive drug and that drug was tens of thousands of dollars, that could translate into potentially thousands of dollars out of pocket costs. Most seniors aren't spending more than $2,000 a year on prescriptions, Fiedler says, but at least one and a half million did in 2021 according to the health policy nonprofit KFF. One common reason people can end up with particularly high drug costs is they're taking an expensive cancer drug. Other scenarios include people with certain immune system disorders or people who have had an organ transplant and take immunosuppressive drugs. And you never know when that might be you. That's why Stacey Ducetzina at Vanderbilt University Medical Center says capping how much seniors have to pay for prescriptions is a big deal. This puts financial security there for people who end up developing a condition that needs a high cost drug so that you know that the drug costs that they will face are not going to bankrupt them. This new price cap will cost the federal government and taxpayers. But Ducetzina says Medicare can now negotiate drug prices and that should offset some of the increased costs. The other way that this comes out is through premiums. So if you are purchasing a Medicare Part D plan, your premium could potentially go up. But she says there are guardrails in place to prevent them from going up too much, at least for the next few years. I'm Samantha Fields from Marketplace. All over the world, according to new research, we're getting worse at reading. The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, surveyed 31 different countries and found that while a handful have managed to improve literacy over the last decade, most have been stuck at a standstill, or are even in decline. Among those countries in decline is the United States. Here to discuss how that shift can affect people's personal economies and our national economy is Daphne Greenberg, a professor at Georgia State University and the director of GSU's Adult Literacy Research Center. Thanks for joining us. Thank you for having me on. So a report came out recently that showed adult literacy in the US is decreasing. But first of all, what actually counts as literacy? That's a very, very good question. Because most people think of literacy as reading and sometimes they include writing. But we think of it as including a lot more. It includes numeracy, such as math. It includes adaptive problem solving. So that's being able to use a computer and the internet and so forth to access information. But there's even a more general definition of literacy. And that is basically whatever an adult wants or needs in order to function to their full potential at the workplace and society and in their family. So how are we doing when it comes to literacy here in the United States compared with other countries as well as how we did in the past? Yeah, so unfortunately, we're not doing as well as many people would think we are. About 28% of adults in the United States are reading at what's considered level one and below, which is really elementary skills. And we really do rank very lowly compared to other countries. But this isn't a brand new problem. We really have not focused enough on the skills of our adults in this country. And as a result, there are a lot of consequences, both for the individual and for society. Most American kids, the vast majority go to school and learn how to read. So how do we end up with adults who really struggle with literacy to the level that you're talking about? That's a really good question. The adult education student is very diverse in the reason why they are at the point they are. So for some of them, it's because they received very poor instruction. They just got passed along grade after grade after grade when they shouldn't have been. For some of them, they were sick as children and missed a lot of school. For some of them, they moved around a lot. And as we know, different schools and different states and different neighborhoods are following different curricula. Some individuals have learning disabilities. Some individuals are immigrants to our country. And so they're learning to read and write in a new language. It really is a very complicated issue in terms of the reasons why. There can obviously be a lot of shame attached to this. And people who struggle with reading or literacy may have developed some skills to hide it. What does it look like when somebody has low literacy, particularly in the workplace? So for instance, many, many, many, many years ago, I tutored a woman who was struggling with reading. And she always came to my tutorial session on time. And I asked her, how did she do that? And she said, well, she used to watch the Cosby Show in those years. And she told me, well, I know that during the second commercial of the Cosby Show, I have to get out of my house and take the bus and walk to the bus stop to get to you on time. And so they develop unbelievable compensatory skills. As another example, you mentioned the workplace. I used to know a person at a dry cleaners who had difficulty with people's names and so forth. And he just literally memorized faces that went along with clothes. So they definitely, definitely do develop a lot of compensatory skills. And you're right. There is a lot of shame associated with low literacy in our country because there is an assumption, which is incorrect, that every adult can read very well in his profession. What's the broader economic impact of the fact that there are so many folks in this country who struggle to read? It has a lot of impact on both society and for the individual. So in terms of our economy, the coalition on adult basic education, for example, cited that low rates of adult literacy actually can lead to a $1.4 trillion loss in gross domestic product. Pro-literacy sites that there's a $100 to $200 billion loss in terms of health care costs. Because you can imagine that if you have difficulty reading and using the internet and so much of health care now is on the portals that you have difficulties accessing health care, you have difficulties reading medical instructions. And that leads to poor health outcomes. There's also the intergenerational transfer of low literacy that can happen because if parents have difficulty reading, then many of them are ashamed to read to their children and they can't help them with homework. And what sorts of strategies actually work to fix this issue? Yeah, so there are adult education programs and it really helps their self-esteem first of all because they realize, wow, I'm not the only one. And if I come and I attend, I will be able to really increase my skills and I'm with a whole bunch of people who really care about me. One of the problems though is that these programs now only access about 10% of adults who really need these programs. And part of the problem is there aren't enough programs. Some people don't know how to access them. A lot of people don't even know that they exist. Definitely Greenberg is director of the Adult Literacy Research Center at Georgia State University. Thank you so much. Thank you, bye-bye. Music Coming up. They're very little wood utilized into commercial and institutional buildings. At least for now. But first, let's do the numbers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 418 points, 1% to finish at 42,573. The NASDAQ subtracted 235 points, 1 and 2,10% to close at 19,486. And the S&P 500 lost 63 points, 1 and 1,10% to end at 59.06. As we recall the memory of the late former president Jimmy Carter, Carter pushed for the creation of the Department of Energy. When he took office in 1977, US imports of crude oil reached what was, at the time, a peak, a little over 2.4 billion barrels according to the Energy Information Administration, just a bit more than we imported in 2023. But by 1981, the year Carter left office, that number had fallen by about a third to just over 1.6 billion barrels. Imports didn't climb back to that 1977 level until 1993. Increased demand in today's world for LNG for export is one reason why natural gas futures heated up 15% today. The other reason? Forecast of a cold January. Bonds rose the yield on the 10-year T-note fell to 4.53% and you're listening to Marketplace. This is Marketplace. I'm Kimberly Adams. Many of us have to get creative to make our finances work in this economy. And one budgeting method is taking off on social media right now that combines nostalgia, Instagram worthy aesthetics, and a desire to get better at managing your money. Oregon Public Broadcasting's Lillian CareBake explores the trend of cash stuffing. Cash stuffing is a modern twist on how your grandmother might have balanced her books. The envelope system. Cash stuffers post videos of perfectly manicured nails delicately organizing their bills. Almost like an unboxing video for their paycheck. Today we are going to be doing a cash stuffing of my December paycheck. I'm going to do an ASMR cash stuffing. One 253-5400. That last clip is Lily Cohen, a 25-year-old who does administrative work in Bangar Maine. She started making cash stuffing videos in 2021 on her YouTube channel, Lily Budgets. Now Cohen has over a million views from strangers watching her separate her paycheck into a pink wallet binder. She is thick this month. We have a lot of ones in here, I'm sure. Her viewers are often people her own age who are also trying to build good financial habits. She finds the public accountability helpful, but the actual cash is cumbersome. Oh yeah, I tried to the bank multiple times a week. And I've made very good friends with the tellers. Cohen's paycheck comes via direct deposit, but then she drives to the bank and pulls it out in cash. She asks the teller for exact denominations for each budget category, like housing, gas, and fun. And like a pro-content creator, she asks for the most fetching Franklin's the bank has. The prettier bills kind of draw the attention of the viewers. It's nice to look at clean, crisp new bills versus the dirty old ones. The videos have sort of a spa like five, even when Cohen is just counting coins. If the money is in cash locked up in a safe at my house, I cannot spend it. And it's true consumer spend less with cash than plastic. Studies show it's actually more painful to part with cash than it is to pay with a card because you actually fork over your hard earned money. That's Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate. And he says this might be a way to get a handle on rising debt. Credit card balances are up 51% from the beginning of 2021. That's part inflation and high interest rates. But consumers are just swiping more often, especially Gen Z. Gen Zers have substantially more credit card debt than millennials did at the same age. And they're also more likely to be using credit. But cash-duffers think the tangible nature helps them save. When you hold onto something, you cherish it more. And so you're less likely to kind of let it go. That's called the endowment effect. Says John Rorke, a professor of economics at Reed College. He says there's a downside though. I know that's going to sound silly, but if you lose your pretty envelope, there's no recourse. Rorke says he doesn't think there are any academic papers about whether making budgeting pretty makes a difference to financial outcomes. But that might be due to lack of study, after all. People who would be doing the research are economists, right? And we are not the people who are into aesthetics. Cohen isn't just into it for the aesthetics though. She invests her money. After she stuffs it in her Roth IRA envelope on her YouTube channel, then she drives back to the bank, deposits the cash, and transfers it to her brokerage account. But she doesn't mind the light work. I love the process of opening it up, of stuffing the money in, of counting it, and having those pretty things can just make it more enjoyable experience. And Cohen says she would keep doing it, even if she didn't post online. In Portland, Oregon, I'm Lollian CareBake for Marketplace. We started the show talking about housing and how there just isn't enough of it in this country. Well, one solution is building more multifamily structures, and some builders are trying to be a bit more climate friendly while doing it. Now typically, when you want to build, say, a high rise, you need really durable materials, like iron, steel, cement, and concrete that also come with a high carbon footprint. But thanks to some new technology and new rules, builders are finding modern uses for a traditional and more climate friendly material. Good. Harvest public media's Kate Grumkey has more. On the northern edge of downtown Milwaukee, one high rise is not like the others. The building is called the Ascent, and it's made of wood. Cross-liminated timber to be exact. Also called CLT. It is 19 stories of mass timber over a six-story concrete parking structure. That's Architect Jason Corp. The Ascent is currently the world's tallest building that's a hybrid of timber and concrete. 15 years ago, it would have been hard to find a wood building that was more than four or five stories tall. But this building stretches up 25 floors, thanks to extra strong CLT. It's made by layering and gluing lumber in a crossing pattern to form massive, strong beams. Corp takes the elevator up to show off a model apartment. 14 floors. It's recurring, less weight, the higher up you go. Inside the ceiling is made of warm, exposed timber that connects to thick wooden support beams, framing a stunning view of Lake Michigan. Originally, Corp says the building's developers considered cross-liminated timber as an aesthetic choice. But the more you dive into it, the more you learn about its other benefits. The largest one is the level of carbon sequestration in the timber. Trees take carbon out of the atmosphere. When you cut down a tree to turn it into cross-liminated timber, you're storing a lot of carbon into a building for a long time. Says John E. Fernandez, a professor of architecture at MIT. When you look at a tree, the fact is that about half of the dry weight of that tree is carbon. The U.S. designers estimate the building offsets 7,200 metric tons of carbon dioxide. They say that's the equivalent of taking 2,400 cars off the road for a year. CLT doesn't just lock carbon into a building. It also avoids emissions from steel and cement. Together those two materials produce almost 15% of planet warming greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. But Fernandez says there's a caveat. The forest the wood comes from needs to be sustainably managed for all of this to work out. Right now CLT is still a relatively rare building material in the U.S. It's really early days. Bill Parsons is the chief operating officer at Woodworks Wood Products Council, which is a nonprofit funded by the forestry industry. Parsons says changes in the International Building Code in the last few years. On the door for high rises made of CLT and there's some momentum around it. Walmart's new home office in Arkansas includes Mass Timber and Microsoft announced it's building two new data centers with CLT. But even though there's this long history of using wood in single-family homes, it hasn't caught on for bigger buildings. There's very little wood utilized into commercial and institutional buildings. Arden says there are 15 tall CLT projects either built or under construction around the U.S. And more in the works. A lot in St. Louis's downtown West neighborhood doesn't look like much right now. It's gated off and covered in gravel. But it will soon have a Mass Timber high rise. That's a bit taller than the one in Milwaukee. Kyle Howerton is a principal at A.H.M. Group, the developer behind this project. Lisa's city officials were shocked when they first heard about it. They didn't realize that you could build something over 300 feet tall using wood. Now Howerton wants this building to inspire similar projects in St. Louis and beyond. I hope that this is a catalyst for more structures being built using the same technologies. Howerton plans to break ground on the climate-friendly high rise next year. In St. Louis, I'm Kate Grumpke for Marketplace. This final note on the way out today, as you've heard by now, President Jimmy Carter passed away yesterday, and among his many legacies is an economic one. His presidency coincided with the last period of really high inflation in this country, seeing him to what was at the time a controversial pick to lead the Fed. Paul Volcker. This came up in an interview, President Carter did with Kai Rizdal back in 2010. Here's a bit of that. Paul Volcker, on the topic of Paul Volcker, if I could just back up for a second. You put him in the job. You, in essence, made this deal with him where he would do what he had to do and you would suffer the political consequences according to your telling of it. Yet it seems to me that he is most remembered and the President he is most associated with is Ronald Reagan for breaking the back of inflation. Does that gaw you at all? Not gaw me, but you know, I recognize him. You recognize him a little bit? Well, you know, I was the one that suffered politically and Ronald Reagan was the one that benefited from the Paul Volcker economic philosophy. But I don't begrudge the fact that it happened during the next term. I thought the next term was going to be mine. President Carter was 100 years old.

Welcome to Tech News Briefing. It's Friday December 27th, I'm James Rundle for the Wall Street Journal. We're hearing from our reporters and colonists about some of the biggest companies, trends and people in tech. And what could be in store for 2025? Coming up on today's show, artificial intelligence is everywhere, propelled by the runaways success of open AI's chat GPT and other models. But the tech behind-generative AI is far more than just the engine for a fancy chatbot. Researchers are exploring how the technology might be used to create bacteria that eats plastic, self-driving cars or potential cures for cancer.
