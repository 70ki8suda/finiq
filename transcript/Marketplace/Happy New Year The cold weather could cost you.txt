We've got an appetizer sampler of stories for you on this first day of 2025 from Boeing to small business to women's growing share of wealth and what that means for the economy. From American public media, this is Marketplace. In New York, I'm Kristen Schwab in for Kyra's doll. It's Wednesday, the first day of January, happy new year. As we enter 2025, we move as we always do deeper into winter. And this year perhaps into steeper heating bills. Natural gas futures this week saw their biggest single day jump in three years. And prices aren't expected to go down anytime soon as the northeast and Midwest move into a bone chilling winter. But it takes more than a cold spell to break a three year record like that. Marketplace's Kaley Wells explains what's going on. Even for a three year high, the most obvious explanation is also having the biggest impact. I mean, natural gas really and truly is driven by weather more than anything else. Tom Singh teaches energy finance at Texas Christian University. If this becomes a deep seeded widespread, long duration cold front, we're going to burn a lot of natural gas, which means we're going to pull a lot of natural gas out of storage. High demand, lower supply, that means higher prices. Also, we can't know just how cold it'll get and how long it'll last. And that uncertainty can lead the market to overreact. But that's not the only uncertainty the market's facing right now. But yeah, to that the war in the Middle East, the uncertainty in the Baltic, the war in Ukraine. Geology professor Grant Walk from Delhause University says uncertainty makes people nervous. People could just be hedging the next few months to see what happens. Now, Econ 101 says when demand goes up, the way to keep prices stable is to increase supply along with it. Randy Albert leads a consulting firm called Shale Advisory Group. And he says that can't happen quickly. It can take 18 months to bring a new gas well online. When Trump says, well, we'll just drill by the grill. That's right. But we don't have enough tech white capacity to get it marked. In other words, we don't have the infrastructure to move the gas from those wells to where it's needed. And the Biden administration hasn't been keen on letting the fossil fuel industry expand. The warning signals being sent to producers and people to provide capital for driller to say, hey, let's go out and drill into wells. And so we're we are where we are production wise long term forecasts have called for a mild winter in most of the country. So prices could dip once the cold weather moves through. But long term, Grant walk of del housing university is also worried about the price spikes that could come during a hot summer later this year. Utilities will want natural gas to create the electricity to power all of those air conditioners that will be cranked up. I'm Kayley Wells for marketplace. Wall Street today was closed for the holiday, but that doesn't mean the economy stops moving. We'll have the details when we do the numbers. So. 2024 was a tough year for Boeing at the beginning of the year, a door plug blew out of a 737 max plane mid flight. The company CEO stepped down a new one came aboard. Then in the fall, more than 30,000 workers went on strike halting production for nearly two months. The company slashed about 17,000 jobs to cut costs in a message to employees and shareholders this past October. Boeing's new CEO said the company has had quote serious lapses in performance unquote and acknowledged that trust in the brand has eroded. Marketplaces Henry app reports on how Boeing could correct its course in 2025. Many of the problems Boeing faced in 2024 did not begin in 2024. David Slotnik, a contributing editor at the point sky says the issues took root over 25 years ago when Boeing merged with MacDonald Douglas. The argument goes that Boeing sort of adopted this accounting first culture that existed at MacDonald Douglas, which similarly hurt that airplane maker. For years, Boeing leaders prioritized the company's stock price, he says, more than the quality of its aircraft. Now the company's facing criminal charges over two fatal crashes of its planes and investigation of the recent crash in South Korea and months of fallout from that door plug incident. The company's CEO said in October Boeing needs quote a fundamental culture change Richard Obalafia with aerodynamic advisory agrees. They need to restore those connections between people who build the jets and supervise the people who build the jets and the people at the top. Supply chain delays, he says, have hampered the company's ability to deliver planes. So it also needs to work better with its thousands of suppliers. So there's no shortage of demand for Boeing's products from airlines says magna maharishi and airlines reporter at skift. Right now they're seeing a ton of travel demand, a huge boom and travel demand that is continuing till last and they obviously want more airplanes, but they're just not getting them out of fast enough rate. Because there's really only one other company that makes big commercial jets airbus as Boeing has struggled in recent years airbus is backlog of orders has grown. So now Boeing might have an opportunity to make up some ground on its competitor again David slotnik at the point sky. What really matters is that they're able to just make these planes consistently after a year full of stops and starts and production he says Boeing wants to start delivering planes at a faster clip. And that's obviously helpful if they can do it, but if they can't do that in a consistent way, then it's really going to be all for nothing. Which makes getting its supply chain and workforce culture and order all the more important if Boeing wants to have a better year. I'm Henry App for Marketplace.

Sometimes though being nimble means flipping your business on its head, transforming your work so much it almost feels like you've made a career pivot. That's where Maddie Gartman's at. She's owner of Gartie goodies in St. Paul, Minnesota, which started as a home bakery and has grown into something else. Maddie, welcome back to the show. Thanks for having me. So I think the last time we talked right was about a year ago. And you were selling cookies through your business and doing some content creation. What's happened in the last year? Yeah, so pretty much for the start of 2024. I decided that I was going to go all in on being a content creator. And there were a couple things that sort of inspired that one is that I was starting to see that I was making more money that route. And there was that I was starting to see that I was making a lot less money by selling cookies. So it seemed like the right time for me to pivot just because I think people just weren't buying custom hand decorated cookies like they used to. Yeah, why do you think that is? I think I think it had a really big boom during the pandemic simply because so many people were on social media and so many people were seeing my business all the time because they were on their phones. And then you know, I can only speculate, but I'm guessing a lot of it has to do with the economy, the price of ingredients, it continues to go up and to make it worth my time. I'm going to charge quite a bit for a cookie. And I don't blame people if that's not where they're putting their money, you know, is towards a fancy cookie. So to me, it just made sense to pivot and go a different direction with my business. Yeah. Well, you are teaching them how to make their own cookies, right? Tell me a little bit more about that and what that transition was like for you because you were a teacher before this. Yeah, so I didn't want to put all of my eggs in one basket of content creation, because that's a little bit scary, but I knew I could always fall back on teaching and luckily there's always been a market for people that want to learn how to take the classes. There's a market for people that just want a fun activity to do with their friends or with their sisters. And I got to partner with a local gardening center that has a great workshop area and basically been able to host a cookie class about once a month for this entire year and they sold out every single time. So that's been really, really great. Oh, wow. And then tell me more about content creation. How is that going because running a cookie business and being a content creator are very different things. Very true. Originally, I got my start on TikTok in 2021 and then I've kind of been able to add the other apps Instagram and YouTube and Facebook and have been able to improve my content creation game, you know, as far as upping the cameras and the microphones and the editing software. So I just post videos of me decorating cookies along with voice overs. Sometimes I tell stories. Sometimes I just talk about my decorating process. And I also often do mystery cookies where people help me figure out different designs for the shape that I'm decorating and kind of it engages a lot of people and people really enjoy watching it. What are you thinking as we get closer to a potential TikTok banner, are you worried about how that might affect your. So what's behind the expectation that women will increasingly hold a larger share of American well. A couple of factors going on here. So as we know women are working more now than ever before. They're making more money. The wage gap is still there, but it's closing. But one of the really big factors is this demographic trend. Maybe boomer generation in the US and around the world has a large chunk of wealth right now and women typically out live men by five years on average. So there's this transfer of wealth, not just from one generation to the next, but intergenerational from men to women. And you write in your story about women coming into wealth. It affects many different industries because I mean generally speaking women spend money differently or have different attitudes towards it. Can you start off by talking about how that works with investments? Yes, definitely. So we're seeing there are gender differences in investing. Obviously these are very high level each person has their own opinions on how they're going to invest. But we definitely see more women a bit more conservative in their investments. So women work really hard to make money and save it, but they're sort of hesitant to risk it. You know, as you know, in investing, there's a balance there. You want to take a certain amount of risk at the same time you don't want it to be too risky and put it all in in crypto or something like that. But we are seeing women reporting that they're having more stockholdy. So fidelity does this great study and they found that in the 2024 study 71% of women had stockholding. That's that's up from only 44% in 2018, which is pretty massive. One thing I thought was really interesting was women's attitudes in philanthropy. Can you talk about how that industry is sort of taking on the change of how women donate money? Yes, so that's one of the most exciting sort of aspects of this trend. And one of the real world effects of it is that women across all income levels and all generations are more likely to donate money to charity than their male capital. They're male counterparts. So there's a lot of research that's done on sort of the motivations for why different people give and one one study has shown that women tend to give based on empathy. And it varies also based on how all the women are, you know, millennial women care about causes like social justice and climate change. Older women sort of ski more towards religious organizations, those focus on reducing poverty, but across the board, you know, women in general are more inclined to give to charity than men. Well, I'd imagine that these changes might shape these two industries a bit, investing in philanthropy. How are how are these industries preparing? Yeah, so this is it's just to be a big change. I mean, just seeing more women having more money, more power, come into the table more, especially when you look at sort of how the wealth management industry is going to have to adapt to it. So a big focus is hiring more women, you know, the wealth management industry is very traditionally male. So they're stepping up efforts to that. And there's also been studies done that show women really want a relationship with their financial advisors. They don't want someone just to come in and tell them what to do. They want to have a conversation, think about their life goals, their values and sort of how investing can align with that. How much do you think this helps close the wealth gap and what work is there left to do? I think this is obviously a really huge positive trend. It's putting more money in the hands of women. The stat from McKinsey and Co is that is that women will control 34 trillion by 2030, which is close to double last year's total. So that's huge. It's more money in the hands of women. And that's a great thing. Where there's more work to be done, I think is that, you know, there's, there's still only, you know, 12% of C-suite positions in the US are occupied by women. There's only 41 out of all the CEOs at S&P 500 companies are women. So it's a positive sign and it's really, really great trend, but it really does highlight that there's more work to be done. Claire Valentine is a reporter at Bloomberg and she recently wrote about the impact of this money changing hands. Claire, thanks so much for joining us. Thank you. What if you had the chance to buy a house for a dollar? You heard me right, a home of your own for one single George Washington. There's a catch though, because isn't there always? To get the deal, you have to commit to renovations and you have to live in the house after no renting or selling. There are programs like this in the US, the city of Baltimore relaunched an initiative like this last year. Meanwhile, decades ago overseas in Northern England, the city of Liverpool launched its own version of this project aimed at regenerating downtrodden areas. The BBC's Liana Bern takes stock of how it's all worked out. For some people in Liverpool, having the chance to buy a home for the knockdown price of just one pound or about $1.25 was irresistible. With the successful applicants to Liverpool's low-cost property sales were buying more of a wreck than a house, stevingly was one of them. There was a huge hole in the roof above the bay window on the first floor collapsed while we were actually working on it. Another buyer, Maxine Sharples, also found herself having to take on heavy renovations. There was a spestos, there was a rat infestation, I had a tree growing out the front bay. There wasn't much apart from crumbling bricks. Liverpool City Council offered people the chance to own a house for just over $1.2013 and 2015. It was part of a regeneration policy to bring abandoned properties back into use. With the average price in Liverpool between $160,000 and $170,000 at the time, the prospect of owning a home for a fraction of that caught people's attention. Tony Mosdale from Liverpool City Council was behind the initiative. We started off with a small pilot scheme of 20 properties and we got something like 750 enquiries and then we rolled out the full scheme and had 2500 applications. Liverpool is one of the UK's biggest cities, with almost half a million residents. But in recent decades industrial decline has hit the economy, increasing poverty and leading to some areas falling into disrepair. There were other challenges, here's steamingly again on the house he bought. It was completely bolted up, there were just kids everywhere messing around as you imagine, because there's no repercussions for anyone if there's no one living there. So it was fairly grim. In total, 120 homes were sold in 2013 and 2015 and anyone buying had to fund the repairs themselves and agree to live there for five years. Victoria Brandon, a student in Liverpool at the time, was one of the first people to secure a house through the programme. I've been watching the house renovation shows and obviously it looks so easy. I learnt so much looking back but at the time it was absolutely stressful. I remember being in the midst of it and thinking is it worth it. The scheme was a much needed step onto the housing ladder for Victoria, but after a few years she decided to leave. We get random kids like banging on the window and for me I just accepted it as part and parcel of the area where it's my partner. It did upset him more. I think that was a factor into us moving. While the initiative to sell the homes at low cost did lessen some of the challenges that blighted the city streets, Tony Mosdale from Liverpool City Council admits those problems haven't gone away. I would say those incidents are not as frequent as they used to be. There is still a way to go and I think in some ways regeneration never finishes as it does always more to do. The council says it's got no plans to revisit the £1 home initiative but it has now moved into offering commercial premises for the same amount. The home buyers like Stephen Lee and Maxine Sharples have spent tens of thousands more renovating their homes than that headline figure. But Sharples says that despite all the challenges it's been worth it. Having the security of your own home that no one can take away from you means that it opens up my life to other possibilities. Inglis says it's been transformational. We absolutely love living here, the people in the neighbourhood because we've all been through the same thing. It's a really nice place to be. We all look out for each other. Liverpool still faces challenges of blight and some of its urban residential areas but the initiative has increased home occupation in the areas where it operated. And residents say it succeeded in rebuilding some of the sense of community lost in the city. I'm the BBC's Leana Burn from Marketplace. This final note on the way out today saw this in the Wall Street Journal. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been taking credit for hefty judgments against people running scams like Ponzi schemes that it'll likely never be able to collect on. The journal reports that over the past 10 years the SEC has written off a whopping $10 billion in fines. Right off's happen when penalties go unpaid for two years. Its collections office uses tactics like garnishing wages to collect fines. A tactic that doesn't work so well when a defendant has the means to pick up and move to a Caribbean island.

I don't think this is necessarily concern of where the tech trade is going forward, but are you going to see some rebalancing and some profit taking? Absolutely. I don't think it's a bad thing for that longer term, but you absolutely want to have those inflation hedges. I think that's going to continue to be a story next year. And Mike, today volatility, the VIX was up 8%, we can overlook that on a Friday. Yeah, I have said before that sometimes if you think that a rally is overextended, that one of the things that you might want to look for are more of these unusual moves where you're getting one, two, maybe even a three standard deviation move within a given day. I don't know that I'm really that concerned about what happened today. We've had a heck of a run as Steve was just pointing out. I wouldn't expect to see a lot of people pairing their winners right before the end of the year if it's in taxable accounts and institutions don't typically take them off their sheets, you know, right before the end of the quarter of their winners. That is so I think I'd be more.
