This product was the talk of the convention, a 77-inch transparent OLED TV that can either show you content on a screen or go full invisibility cloak and reveal what's behind it. It'd be perfect for the living room of a billionaire Marvel villain when it ships because it's expected to cost in the tens of thousands of dollars and has no real practical purpose.LG is the only one trying out transparency, Samsung also revealed a C-through TV of its own at CES. What do you think? Gimmick or new design aesthetic for the rich and famous? I think it's somewhere in the middle. I know that's a cop out, but when I heard transparent TV, I thought it would be like this plastic semi-translucent thing, but when you see this, it literally goes, it is a glass box. There's nothing in it. And I think the 3D nature of it was something I didn't expect is that it's got multiple modes. One mode shows off its 3D effect, so you can turn it into an aquarium that looks like there's fish swimming around in it because it is a box. But then you can also watch regular TV on it. I was reading some reviews again on like, how did the TV actually perform? And it's not quite up to par with the top-aligned models from LG. And so that could be a point of kind of departure for these big TV nerds. They don't want to watch something that they know they could get better resolution somewhere else out there, but I will say it was cool, especially kind of that 3D effect that we spoke about. Up next, some more science breakthroughs coming your way. Neil, you've had the chance to work with plenty of strong leaders in your career. What traits do you think are the most important? In my experience, a few things do stand out, like leading by example, taking risks and being passionate. And for all those influential leaders out there, there's the Range Rover Sport. That's definitely a match made in heaven. Each model strikes an ideal balance between on-road performance and world-renowned off-road capability of sophisticated refinement and visceral power. And you can build a Range Rover Sport that matches your leadership style at Range Rover Sport at LandRoverUSA.com. That's LandRoverUSA.com. Okay, so I know this is a science positive episode, but this next story is less of an innovation and more of a debunking. Remember, blue zones, those special places around the world where people seem to live longer, healthier lives, thanks to a simple set of easily repeatable behaviors. Stuff like community involvement and specific diets were enough to produce life spans well into the 90s and 100s and region stretching from Okinawa, Japan to Loma, Linda, California. The only issue? Some scientists think it's a bunch of Huha. One postdoctoral researcher from Australia, Dr. Newman, published a paper that was recently honored at the IG Nobel Prizes, a humorist spinoff of the Nobel Prizes, that chalked up the increased life spans found in blue zones to shoddy record keeping. Newman found that areas with high levels of faulty records also had high levels of centrenarians living there. One, especially a reason it's an example, is a 2010 Japanese study that found that 230,000 centenarians were actually just a result of unreported deaths. So, now there's been some pushback to Newman's work and his paper is not peer reviewed yet, but it certainly cast blue zones in a different light. It did and it made a lot of waves because the blue zones brand has quietly become huge. There's blue zones iced tea, there's blue zones bean soups, there's eight books and Netflix series, partnerships, a million dollar program for other cities to become part of blue zones. We even talked about real estate developments getting a blue zone designation, which probably cost money that they had to play blue zones for. So, it was maybe a direct threat to the global blue zones brand and the blue zones guy who's a national geographic reporter who turned blue zones from just a concept into this global brand certainly pushed back on the research from the doctor. What's the name? Dr. Newman, sorry, Dr. Newman, and said, look, we cross check everything. You think we just go and take everybody, take these cities word for the fact that how many people live over 100. We did our research. So, there was, there's certainly a debate over that, but I think it knocked down blue zones a little bit from its perch. One thing that is for sure though, longevity is becoming much more invoked these days. Remember, there's Brian Johnson, the former tech founder who now has devoted all his time and money and dignity to try to slow aging. You also see a rise in people trying out these different protocols to live longer, drinking is going down. There is definitely a vibe shift in our society towards longevity. So, even if blue zones, the brand might have taken a hit, I do think this is a trend that is moving towards longevity being more popular. And also, the stuff that he says people in blue zones do is kind of universal and seems good for lack of a better word. I mean, it's like eat nutritious diet, fruits and vegetables, get plenty of physical activity, build physical activity, into your daily life, prioritize family and community, don't smoke, drink and moderation. I mean, even if blue zones are bunk or a bunch of hula as you say, I mean, those seem to be like some worthwhile principles to follow. What's the trickiest thing to move in the world? My mind goes straight to carrying a very full beer from the bar to the table without any spillage, but no, there's something far more dicey and scientists have finally cracked how to do it. Researchers at the CERN Particle Physics Lab in Switzerland have learned how to move anti-matter and are preparing to take it on a truck to other labs. The first time anyone has ever moved anti-matter. Anti-matter is the most expensive material on Earth, requiring several trillion dollars just to make a single gram. And transporting it is not easy. The only time it's ever been done is in fiction. Dan Brown's novel Angels and Demons went terrorist steel a quarter gram from CERN and planned to use it to blow up the Vatican. And that's kind of the problem with shuttling anti-matter around. If it comes into contact with matter, both get annihilated instantly. The scientists say it won't result in any significant explosion if it rubs elbows with matter, but it would mean a lot of work and money will have gone down the drain. So they're taking remarkable precautions to make sure the anti-matter stays isolated in a vacuum when it is moved. Toby, I can't wait for this. I can't wait for it either, but my first question was, why the heck are we moving it at all? And part of the reason is that anti-matter can tell us a lot about just the origins of the universe because technically when the big brain happened, equal amounts of matter and anti-matter were created. But if you look out in the known universe, there's a lot of matter out there. So why did the balance shift so heavily in favor of matter? These are the fundamental questions of our universe in so-and-order to study them. They want to compare matter with anti-matter very closely to see where the differences are. And the reason why they can't do it is the current positioning of anti-matter is affected by some magnetic fields of the Earth. So they need to bring it to a place where it's less affected by that so they can more efficiently measure it. But yeah, I'm excited too. They're doing it on trucks too. You said that they're putting them in vacuums so they don't come in contact with anti-matter, but what about are it coming in contact with matter? But what about a little bump in the road or something like that? They're putting them on seven ton trucks and actually driving them through the countryside. So that would be quite the nervy piloting job of trying to drive to... I didn't do Toby, didn't I? To eyes on the road. We need a helicopter police cam of this like the OJ Bronco Chase. Yeah, it probably won't be quite as fast-paced, but it will be fun to watch. Of all the uses of AI that have arisen over the past year, I think this one is my favorite. When Mount Vesuvius erupted over 2000 years ago, some papyrus scrolls actually ended up surviving, but the carbonized scrolls are incredibly delicate to handle and crumble if you try to unroll them. Enter the Vesuvius Challenge, a competition funded by some Silicon Valley and entrepreneurs that promised to reward a cash price to anyone who could find a way to peer inside the scrolls without actually unrolling them. Back in February of this year, a team of three students won the $700,000 grand prize using AI to decipher the scrolls hidden secrets. Despite the contest organizers estimating a less than 30% probability of anyone actually meeting the contest criteria, the three students machine learning algorithm deciphered more than 2000 characters in the scrolls, exceeding the grand prize's requirements. This was definitely one of my favorite stories of the year, Neil, because it is using AI to do something extremely practical, actually. It's extremely practical, extremely cool, and the people who won it show the global nature of this and how competitions like this can actually be really effective. I mean, the three, the guys who won the $700,000 prize were an Egyptian PhD student in Germany, a robotic student in Switzerland and that a computer science student in Nebraska, all young, all in it, just to, they said it was like the most pure form of playing a video game. So I think this is cool and we'll probably see similar competitions to accomplish different things that machine learning can do. And I think we buried the lead here too, what did the passages say? First, the first word that was deciphered was just the word for purple, actually, but the passage in general, they think it is a kind of philosophical discussion of life's pleasures. So talking about music and food, a lot of people likened it to reading a 2000 year old blog post about just how to enjoy life. So it shows you self health books or self reflection books do go back to the very beginning of Western civilization. Okay, let's close out the show with perhaps the most important scientific discovery of the year. Monkeys cannot type out the complete works of William Shakespeare given infinite time because the universe will run out before then. I'll back up. There's a famous mathematical concept called the infinite monkey theory, which suggests that a monkey pressing random keys on a typewriter would eventually write out a complete works of Shakespeare with an infinite amount of time because anything is possible over an infinite time horizon. However, two Australian researchers rejected the theory and a peer reviewed study. They claimed that the amount of time it would take for a monkey typing to write out the complete works of Shakespeare would be far longer than the lifespan of our universe, one Google years. So they rejected the infinite monkey theory as misleading. Even getting the monkeys to write out a single word would be a challenge. If all 200,000 chimpanzees were recruited and typed at a rate of one key per second until the universe ended, there would only be a 5% chance a single one would type out the word bananas. The probability of one writing a coherent sentence would be one in 10 million billion billion. Toby, are you buying this? Well, I'm buying it, but I feel like they are not jiving with the concept of infinity here. Whenever you put a time horizon on infinity, it ceases to become infinity. So yes, technically all the no-and-monkeys in the universe couldn't type Shakespeare before the heat death of our universe, but that's the key word here. It's an infinite monkey theorem. They need infinite time to do it. So they were just saying it's not practical in our no-and-universe, but I still think the infinite monkey theorem does hold true because that's the whole concept of infinity right there. I think I could be a published scientist if I said that this is not practical. Right, yeah. I could have told you that. Maybe one sum of words. It was fun though to hear that they would have been a 5% chance that they would be able to successfully type the word bananas in its own lifetime. So it is a fun, kind of rabbit hole to go down. I actually do love the infinite monkey theorem too because I wrote a paper back in high school that was basically asking if it was a philosophical discussion really, but if someone recreated a text word for word, but in a different time period under different historical and environmental circumstances, is it still the same piece of work? So if I wrote Shakespeare today, would it still be considered the same piece of work given our current modern formatting? And so it is just a fun thing to think about. Like if a monkey wrote Shakespeare, is it still Shakespeare at that point or is it become something else? So it's fun to think about beyond just the mathematical ideas behind it. So it's like how much would you have to reduce the amount of keys for a monkey to be able to plausibly type out Shakespeare by the end of the universe? You know, if we got rid of the return, the shift, I'm looking at my keyboard. Now there's a lot of extraneous keys. So if we just narrowed it to the point of view, well, it is a typewriter. A typewriter, so none of that has it anyway. Right, I think it just has, you know, I just wonder what the minimum amount of keys, you know, I guess then you couldn't, you would miss some letters in Shakespeare. Anyway, wow. I'm getting deep into the infinite monkey theorem, but Christmas is tomorrow, Hanukkah is tomorrow. So we need a wrap up. Hope you were all filled with a little more optimism about the world and a little more understanding of how monkeys type on a typewriter.
