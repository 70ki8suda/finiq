Does it even make sense to set goals on new years at an annual cadence? Yeah, it's totally fine You know, there actually is some research that shows that I think they call it like the fresh start effect But basically beginning of the day, beginning of the week, beginning of the year, beginning of the month Any time that you kind of have this feeling of rebirth or starting a new There is a little bit of a rise in motivation So it's a natural thing I mean, we all do it because we're all kind of thinking about how can my next year be better than my last year And what am I hoping to achieve and so on So it's a very natural thing I don't think there's anything wrong with using that momentum or using that motivation for you There also isn't any reason to wait if you feel like making a change earlier in the year or at a different time There's nothing special about waiting until January But certainly momentum is a powerful thing And if you feel like you have some now then go ahead and take advantage of it Speaking of last year, last December, you post this thought starter to your newsletter readers It's one year from now, the habit you were hoping to build during the year didn't stick What is the most likely reason it failed? Why is predicting the reason a habit failed in the future worth thinking about in the present now? Well, there are many examples of this kind of thing in business and in life You know, there's kind of like failure pre-mortem as they call it But basically it's so unlikely that you will stick to habit and just do it forever Everyone is going to fall off course at some point and there's going to be some interruption of life that weasels its way in Maybe it's your kids get sick or you have to travel for work or you need to do something for your parents or whatever it is But we all have things that come up And when your habits fall off track, it's helpful to have a plan for how you go how you're going to get back on track quickly And I think actually as I have studied more and more people who build habits and looked at people who are kind of top performers So to speak in their particular domain These people are human just like everyone else right they make mistakes and they fall of course But one pattern that they do tend to share is they get back on track quickly And if the reclaiming of your habit is fast, the breaking of it doesn't matter that much So you get to the end of the year and it's just a little blip on the radar or you slipped up two or three times So for all of those reasons it's very helpful and of course I think we all know that having some kind of consistency has power And so if you can get back on track quickly then you can often get the results you want without needing to be perfect Is the process of getting back on track with your habits the same as starting out in the first place or as a kind of like writing a bike where you can pick it up a little easier? Yeah, that's a good question You know I think broadly we could break a habit into two different kind of core problems The first problem is getting started and the second problem is sticking with it And now at some level what does it mean to stick with something? Well it basically means that you get started each day So we could say ultimately this boils down to being good at starting And if you can just do that day and day out then you are consistent And there are a variety of things that you can do to make starting easier You can optimize your environment you can scale the habit down to make it easier to get going There are ways to track progress and kind of try to build up a feeling momentum And we can talk about all that stuff in more detail if you want But you do in the beginning I think need to have a couple things in mind that maybe you don't need to worry about as much once you're already going with the habit or once you're picking up a habit that you've done consistently And I would say two of the core things to think about when you're trying to build a habit for the first time The first one is what would this look like if it was fun? What would it look like if it was fun to meditate every day? What would it look like if I enjoyed exercising? What would it look like if it was fun for me to write? And there are not a thousand ways to do everything in life But there's almost always more than one way And it's worth it to think about what is the version of this habit that I am most genuinely excited about The most common New Year's resolutions do some form of exercise And I kind of feel like a lot of people go to the gym in January just because they feel like they should be going to the gym or like society wants them to go to the gym And you should choose the version of that habit that's most compelling to you You know, yoga, rock climbing, kayaking, go for a run Like we could come up with a very long list of ways to live an active life And you should choose the version of that that's most appealing to you So I think it's worth leaning against this question of what would this look like if it was fun for me? That's a really good place to start Speaking of stuff that is fun for me I'm going to be selfish here for a second and use you while we have you I want to get better at golf Neil does as well, I can tell in his face But I live in New York City How would you set up kind of a get better at golf system? What should step one be for us? Yeah, that's an interesting question I mean, I think you have to play with or sit with the question of like How good can you get at golf if you're not on a golf course? And so at some point this might come down to prioritizing your time and figuring out how to actually get out to a course more consistently But assuming that that's not possible and you are going to be in the city more You got to come up with like a list of all the things that you could potentially do whether it's you know getting to a simulator or Installing some kind of putting green in your apartment or whatever it is And then I think there are a lot at once you figure out what the actual behavior is going to be There are a lot of things you can do to optimize it. So like let's take the putting green in the apartment I had one reader who he would go to a He would go to his guitar lessons and he would practice and play with his instructor and then he go home And he wouldn't really do anything throughout the week and they go back the next week and his instructor be like you didn't practice You're not going to get better at this And so he took his guitar stand and put it in the middle of the living room where he'd pass it 30 times a day And now he's much more likely to play So that's one simple example of environment design and we could think about doing the same sort of thing for golf If you're only practicing when you're going to see an instructor you might improve a little bit But if you're not going every day or practicing every day, it's gonna be hard to really get better So making it more obvious is one example And then I've kind of think given the environmental constraints of this one It's gonna come down to being creative and figuring out like how can you tack on Around a golf to every work trip or how can you tack on around a golf to every time that you like lead the city to visit your family Basically anytime that you're getting out to somewhere where it's more likely to To be able to actually get on to a course James. You have no idea how much ammunition you're providing me right now Because listen James clear told me I have to go practice golf mom I'm so sorry that I'm home for Christmas and I'm hitting the course So thank you for all that that was that was actually very enlightening as well sure So sticking in the sports category my old soccer coach always used to say he was British So this is my British accent Toby do you love to win or do you hate to lose? I never had a great answer for it. So I'm turning it over to you What is a more effective motivator positive or negative reinforcement? That's interesting. Do you love to want to do hate lose? Okay, so there are two thoughts to come to mind The last part of your question what is a more effective motivator? They are both effective motivators. I find that in the long run It is often better to have some kind of positive motivation to pull you forward In the short run negative consequences for sure will shape your behavior And you know you touch a hot stove once and burn yourself you don't do it for most of the rest of your life unless it's an accident So like that negative consequence certainly has shaped your behavior and we can think of many examples of that throughout life However, there is an interesting strategic piece to this which is In some cases you can actually win by avoiding loss Better than you can by chasing victory. So the classic example of this is if you're playing tennis At the amateur level if you're playing tennis in high school or again somebody in your neighborhood or something like that Almost always the way to win that match is to just have fewer unforstaires Just keep the ball and play keep going until your opponent makes a mistake And so in that case avoiding failure is actually the best path to win However at the high level you know if you're playing in your Roger Federer or Serena Williams or something The pros have to play to win they can't play to not lose because their opponent will keep the ball and play all day long And so I think it's worth asking yourself at what level am I playing and you know what am I actually working on here In a lot of cases you can make a great deal of progress by avoiding mistakes But when you're at the top of your field you often have to play to win And so there's a strategic side of this but then there's also the question of like do positive reinforcements or negative reinforcements work The answer is yes but I think positive is better in the long run Sorry to take us off tov's coaching personal coaching track but accountability partners are another popular mechanism For forming a habit where you rely on the peer pressure of someone else to keep you on track Do you believe in accountability partners and is there ever a world in which they could become a crutch in a bad way? So the short answer is yes I believe in them But I actually think that they are much more common than they realize and they take a much different shape than they then we realize and they for sure work in both positive and negative ways The way that I would describe this you know most people think about an accountability partner and they think about like actually signing up with a group or enlisting a friend to you know keep track of whether they did their workout or something I would say if we just broaden this a little bit to say what is the social dynamic and how do you so how does your social environment influence your habits The answer is in a great and very meaningful way so we are all part of multiple groups some of those groups are large like what it means to be American some of those groups are small like what it means to be a neighbor on your street or a member of the local CrossFit gym And all of these groups large and small they have an influence on your behavior and habits and when actions are aligned with the expectations of the group with like those social norms habits are pretty attractive and the social environment will really help like us or you along and when habits go against the grain of the expectations of the group when they kind of add a little bit of friction between you and your social relationships that's a form of accountability to sometimes not always the kind that you want and habits will be very hard to build and ultimately this comes back to one of the like deepest human needs that we all have which is a desire to bond and connect you know we all were humans are social creatures we all want to be a part of something even if it's just your little family unit and so if people have to decide between you know I have habits that I don't really love but I fit in I belong I'm part of something or I have the habits that I want to have but I'm cast out I'm ostracized and criticized a lot of the time the desire to belong will overpower the desire to improve and so as best as possible you need to get those two things a little bit more you know you have to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire to be a part of the desire rational rational legal rule and regulatory law base and regulations, or legal deterrent, or legal deterrent as a moral natural move, and LTCHA legal頲 1983のある tollすごく anあきづくん同じめったライブものはためぇ選びますファーストいつも今以下をあたるったり�親がコメントだと思うんですねその文が community edsonの Subtreん great述べたりはとんけん量餅選鉄の一地内でなんか遍々な睡星をスライ as 太の8それって 民主ойれのは獲得できるのが 身を Aurina 、「エンティオン、お ShaanTRAN streo ジェンシ e N two Sir Fighter a Sup'knin 部隊が二人集件しなさん頂いていました!」また that't speak no way of losing to 3rdsそう次は 例えば tratarוע用もありません試合で クルスより一 momentoだったけど後ろになる関係なのか私たちは腹あああ。でも 腹がないと常に  Saharaのようや人は将来も Jumping-Royer 2は10時30年でそれをそれに累えますたまえ人は場合も何もここのように包まないがトラッツブドイツンとがそれに都有力を解くことができる陳舗がいいですそれがそれもむしそろ一日お見せ全沢できまずはThe Social Expectation に小麦の上にすごく水沢しい素姫茶にして、それはなら追いやいと言う事頃に、玉豊城残りももっと仕事会った日だったいうことであまりかけているのか muriででも、いい気が付いて To have and the core ideas like how can I build connection with people who already have the habits I want to have and the more that those people start to become your friends or start to populate your thoughts the more that you're gonna feel compelled to do those things as well this is just making me reconsider each other because we spend so much time with each other hosting these daily podcast we better rub off in each other in the best way, Snail so you mentioned social media a little bit in that last answer and I want to talk about your social media accountorn外のものがいているささどう時間ぽしてるのに上手さらちゃうので If you think about building habits or making positive change over talking about some kind of transformation or evolution and of course, you know, evolution is this huge driving force in nature and so there there's a lot of inspiration crossover there. As far as like what my profile picture is and why it shows that I have a very odd social media accounts, you know like I never show my face. My Instagram account is just like blocks of text and you know different quotes and sayings it's a very strange feed but my way of thinking about it is like.I don't really care about being front and center. I want the ideas to be front and center and I want a brand that's known by name not by face. So like Calvin Klein or Kate Spade or something like that like you know some people might know what Calvin Klein looks like but the vast majority people know the name but not the face. And I think that's fine like James Clear could be like that too. And I also feel like it's a useful handicap, you know like I always think. I don't have anything to hide behind like it's just the ideas so they better be good because otherwise people are going to stop paying attention. We'll be back with more James Clear right after this break. Neil you've had the chance to work with plenty of strong leaders in your career. What traits you think are the most important. In my experience a few things do stand out like leading by example taking risks and being passionate. And for all those influential leaders out there there's the range rover sport. That's definitely a match made in heaven. Each model strikes an ideal balance between on-road performance and world renowned off-road capability of sophisticated refinement and visceral power. And you can build a Range Rover Sport that matches your leadership style at Range Rover Sport at Land Rover USA.com. That's Land Rover USA.com. You have talked to lots of different Fortune 500 companies Capital One, Cisco, GE, Honda. The list goes on. What do these Fortune 500 companies want to know? What are they looking for from you? The quote unquote habit guy. They're looking for the same thing everybody else is looking for which is consistency. Most of the time they know the things that they want their team to do they're just trying to get them to do them more frequently. So I think we all could do this if you were going to just do like a classic 80-20 analysis on your job. You're going to write down everything that you do and then we're going to draw a line at the top 20% and you're not allowed to do the bottom 80% of tasks. But if you really crush it on the top 20% if you just totally knock it out of the park you probably still have a job because those are the things that really move the needle. We all sort of implicitly know what some of those things are and all these companies the same way like they know what really matters. And so what they're trying to do is to get their team there you know I'll speak to 800 salespeople or their top 300 executives or something like that. They're trying to get people to direct their attention towards those things more and to do them more consistently. Is setting goals for others like you would do in a business environment similar to setting goals for yourself or is there a different calculus that you would need to take? At some root level it is the same but I do think there are some meaningful differences. The primary difference is that when you set goals for yourself you're the one who's setting them and you're the one who's in control. In business often as the executive or as the leader or whatever you're setting goals for a bunch of other people who didn't choose that goal and then are asked to you know fall through on it. And that often does not go well because people want to be in control of their time and attention and you know energy and so on. I think the key in either case is that it's really helpful to be able to draw a through line from the goal that you're asking people to follow to the type of person that you're asking them to be and how it serves them. So in the individual case I call this identity based habits and the core idea is that you don't start by asking yourself what do I wish to achieve you start by asking yourself who do I wish to become. And by focusing on the type of identity that you want to build and the type of person that you're hoping to become you can see how your habits are reinforcing a particular action. So for example rather than worrying about like oh I want to lose 30 pounds in the next six months you focus on building the identity of I'm the type of person who doesn't this workouts. Now in the team context this becomes a little broader because often when we talk about identity in the business we're talking about like what is the culture and so you need to be really clear about who are we and what are we trying to achieve. And if you can get people to buy into that vision or that shared identity then it becomes a little easier if you can connect the goal to that and you can say hey listen we all say that we're in on this we also we want to become this here's how these goals kind of feed in to that bigger picture. So I think that helps with some alignment. There's one more thing that I want to mention that I think is particularly important with business goals and just driving results in business which is getting incentives aligned. And this is one of the trickiest things with companies because incentives are hard but there's the story that illustrates I think this well so in the early 90s somewhere around that time frame. Boeing the airplane manufacturer the story is that they were switching from manually driven planes manually driven wings by the pilots to software driven. And on the first test flight where they were going to test this software they require that the engineers who designed the software be on the flight. And partially there was a reason for that like you know they're going to test things out that may adjust some things on the fly and so on. Want to see how the system responded but also I always think like man better get it right you know like what a beautiful alignment of incentives the person who designs the thing their neck is on the line too. And I think if we ask ourselves honestly are the incentives that cleanly aligned in most of our businesses or institutions a lot of the time the answer is no. And I always think you should ask yourself like first who is doing the work who reads the rewards who bears the consequences. And when the incentives are aligned it's often the same person for all three. And when this any incentives are misaligned somebody else is doing the work somebody else is bearing the consequences and somebody else is reaping the rewards. And so as best as possible you need to figure out ways to get the incentives and lines and people will naturally want to do things that serve them and avoid things that punish them. That reminds me it's kind of curious why Jeff Bezos goes up in his company's rocket but Elon Musk doesn't. Oh interesting. It's trying to start something. James we are pretty smart but I assume that not all of your ideas just kind of spring out of your head one day who are some of the people writers thinkers that have been a source of inspiration for you. Oh man they're literally hundreds I actually keep a list of sources on my website so if you go Jamescare.com slash thanks it's like a thank you page to all the people that have been various inspirations and sort of sources of ideas to me. I am it would be impossible to list everybody there you know hundreds of sources and atomic habits alone. And I feel like I'm always looking I don't even really read books anymore I kind of like read chapters or read sentences like I'm just like looking for a little bit of insight romco I really like how that was phrased or well I really like how the way that they unpack that maybe I can you know like take that and make a my own or use that in some way. So pretty much everything that I share two things are true the first is pretty much everything is a reminder to myself so like I struggle with all this stuff too and it's just a way of me trying to pull myself back to center. And then the second thing is almost nothing that I share is something that I originally thought of. I feel like my value is that I try to put it in a way that it's easy to understand and easy to apply but the idea is almost all originated elsewhere. And I think we have this somewhat incorrect view of creativity that creativity is origination that it is like the creation of something from nothing but actually I think almost every form of creativity is synthesis. It is the connecting of ideas that were previously unconnected it is the sharing of something that has already been out there but has never quite been put that way or has never quite been delivered in that fashion. And that I feel like is my job is to come across the very best ideas I can and then to deliver them in a way where you think you know what I always have kind of felt that but I just didn't have the way to the language for it or I've always believed that are seen that in my life too but I've never heard it put that way. And if I can do that and try to deliver ideas into more useful or more actionable or practical fashion then I feel like that is a lot of value and I'm happy to play that role and other people can play different roles. That's our job too actually at morning brew that's we are synth synthesizers of information so that definitely preaching to the choir there. All right I'm sure for our final question of the day there's someone out there right now who is debating whether to follow through on their newly minted New Year's resolution maybe they're deciding whether to go to the gym right now what would you say to them to get them on track to start the year off right. So two things one big picture one tactical so big picture a lot of the time I feel like the two best time frames to focus on our 10 years or one hour you know so like 10 years is think about any big meaningful thing in your life that you like to achieve creating a successful marriage raising kids that you're proud of getting in the best shape your life launching a successful business finishing a book like whatever it is is probably like a multi year thing. And so you can keep that big picture 10 year vision in your mind and then scale it down to one hour what can I do in the next hour that moves me toward where I want to be 10 years from now and if you can do that then I think you start to see how small changes can really add up how these small actions day in a day out and can accumulate into something meaningful. And it really doesn't take much to feel good about yourself or to feel like it's moving forward you know like all you really need is five good minutes five good minutes of exercise can reset your mood for the day five good minutes of conversation can restore relationship that's been shattered or has been you know fragmented five good minutes of writing can make you feel like the manuscripts and forward again so it doesn't take much so that's a big picture view 10 years or one hour and then the tactical thing is utilize what I call the two minute rule so very simple just so you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see thatイエ陽を fぇ嶋で操作しやすい謎の獗員か人が水を割れば、 stingylessを再び入って救った怪我を倒して才ばないになったそういうレ生かに返す時間を解いていきたいと思います。今回、先日は大学校の非常に大学校の確保に変身で出 virtualoi田蓮会で投資する時のコメントが だって、南東生ごとを見てくれて います知事この產品をのせいに思いください何の人の内容をしてもらいます鹿い私が 買いながら演 Betsy bonesを見たことがではないから併って試合話を繰り返していく目標は単調иーの調理者 ec試合42���ι敏銃鏗の手を reviews良い視聴でき combinesんうえいっ before you goにょう has one more thing to tell youIt's time to come a clean hosting morning brudaleisnt my only jobWaitAre you Batman?NoWhen I'm not here sitting next to TobyI'm also the executive editorof morning bruce free daily newsletterIf you love the podYou'll love the newsletterNot only does it give youYou're daily dose of newsBut it also has crosswordsAnd trivia jokes written by peopleWay funnier than me and TobyI hate to admit itBut it's trueI read it every dayI think you all will loveAdding it to your routine as well Subscribe now at morningbrue.comOr head to the link in the show notesWelcome to Closing BellI'm Scott Walker live from Post 9Here at the New York Stock ExchangeWe're an hour away from the close on this holiday short and trading day
