FreemanAnd I'm Toby HowellToday we are joined by Morning Brew's Workplace WhispersAnd host of the per my last email podcastKyle Haggi and Kayla LopezKyle and Kayla join us to break down the biggest workplace stories of this year and the nextIt's Monday December 23rdLet's RideKyle and KaylaWelcome to the showThanks for having usJust real quick before we dive inCan you give our listeners a quick explanation of who might enjoy or who might find usefulYour show per my last emailWell obviously everyone would love the showBut early to mid career professionals looking to level up in their careerThey want help navigating some of the thorniest work-life scenariosPer my last email the show for themSweet so let's dive into some of those issuesAnd begin withWhat's expected to be the number one workplace battle of 2025Return to officeYes it feels like we've been talking about the end of remote work for years nowBut the push to bring workers back to the office ramped up in a big way in September When one of the nation's largest companies Amazon said it would require employeesTo work from the office five days a week Meanwhile Starbucks said starting next year it'll begin actually enforcing its hybrid work policyThat requires employees to commute three days a week Many see ulterior motives by these companies here namely something called backdoor layoffsThe theory goes Amazon Starbucks and other companies cracking down on remote workThink they have too many employeesBut instead of going through the grueling process of laying people off themselvesThey're mandating return to office to accomplish the same thingBecause they know angry employees who love their work from home setupWe'll just voluntarily quitKyle and Kayla do you think there's any validity to this backdoor layoff conceptAnd more broadly how do you see the remote work battle lines being drawn in 2025I mean first if I work at Starbucks and they're making me come in and Brian Nichols is like taking his private jet from California to SeattleThis is the new CEO you're talking aboutThey're allowing to live in Southern California and commute up to SeattleExactly I would be pretty pissedI mean I think this is all about voluntary layoffsEven in Andy Jassy the CEO of Amazon's noteHe said we're doing this as well to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managersSo I think this is a way to right size without actually having to assess talentIt's just an easier way to get people to quit if they don't want to work thereThey like their work from home setupAnd I'm actually like pretty disappointed this feels like a big stepBackwards particularly from Amazon who's always been super innovativeThey were like people don't need to go into a physical bookstoreWe can actually sell books online and embrace these new technologiesAnd now it seems like but people still need to work in an officeIt feels backwards and I'm a little disappointed in AmazonYeah I think my hottest take here is that this is just lazinessIt's laziness from the management team that basically is pining for these likeOlder the olden days when they could tell how hard people were working by standing behind their deskAnd I think that instead of doing the actual work of determining who were high performersWho maybe should be downsized or right sized or whatever the hell they want to talk aboutThey're just saying if you work from home and you want to stay there just leaveAnd I think that that's a very lazy practiceAnd it's not going to turn into improved performanceIt's maybe going to cut costs for a little bit but I don't think it's going to do that much in the long runI do also want to talk about the department of government efficiencyAKA Doge hereIt's the non-governmental agency led by Elon Musk and Vivek Rameshwami Their goal is to cut costs across the governmentCut bloat as well and one of the ideas they floated is ending remote work for federal employeesBut they've explicitly come out and said we want to downsize a federal workforceAnd we think this is the mechanism we can use for doing itSo I guess my question is would you rather have Amazon or Starbucks just come out and say likeHey we are doing this to cut employees or do you think that it is better to do it in this like backdoorlyAvs method a little bit under the more under the radarIf I'm an employee I'd rather than just be honestI think from Amazon's perspective they have so many employees that it's probably hard to goAnd assess each individual's talent and like make layoffs that waySo this is like just a more effective way for them to do thatBut I'd rather them just be honestWell Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garmin did actually say this explicitly He said if there are people who just don't work well in that environment and don't want toThat's okay there are companies there are other companies aroundSo he was basically giving Amazon employees license to go applyThat didn't want to come back to the office license to go applyAlso where my question is also around recruitment rightSo Amazon may be downsizing now and they're like it's okayWe have too many employees and people who don't want to come into the office are going to leaveThat this is kind of all shaking out the way we want and the hyperformers are going to continue to come inBut what about when they have to compete against Google, Microsoft, other big tech companiesFor workers going forward they're not they're not going to be able to say we have these remote flexible work environmentsLike our competitors and that may put them at a disadvantage in the futureI think it depends on the general environment like I think if every single company starts to enactMandatory return to office policies then employees may not have a choiceBut I think if companies like Allstate which we talked about in a previous episodedecide to make co-working, inflexible working, and hybrid working more of an optionThey're going to have the leg up and you will see in the long run better talentAnd you're going to be going and driving to those companiesYeah ultimately like it is a war for talent I think the genius out of the bottle on hybrid workAnd so if you're a very talented employee and you want to work in a hybrid setupI think there is going to be a company that will pay you the same to do thatAnd you're ultimately going to end up there and so I think Amazon is going to be stuck in this like messy middleWhere if you want to work for a large company you probably also want to work hybridIf you want to work in person and like tackle really really thorny challengesYou might want to go for a start up and that's not what Amazon is If we should revisit this segment if Amazon has just a killer year If Starbucks just has a killer year maybe it does workYeah I mean we're all pupuing it right now because workers have shown this desire from flexibilityBut maybe good old fashioned in person office working arrangements are going to be best for the company in the long runIt is very fascinating to see how much workers value flexible environments They value it more than even money So that is a pretty fascinating and start statistic right there Okay so this next topic I want to ask you guys about also deals with this concept of layoffs But this time it's a term called sneaky layoffs You all actually spoke about it on your show and defined it as these tiny technicalities that big companies are using to justify firing someone Maybe just laying them off So what are these tiny technicalities earlier this year meta laid off about 30 employees in their LA office for misusing their $25 meal credits The employees were found to be spending them on things like nail polish toothpaste non food items Another instance of this happened at EY the big accounting firm which fired employees for watching multiple online training sessions at the same time You can't pay me to do this I want how are you doing? Sometimes gasp they were using multiple monitors Fidelity fired some workers you guys spoke about this on your show for joining a fantasy football league at work which violated company gambling policies So to the average person letting go of someone over these seemingly minor offenses seems pretty crazy But what is the broader context here are these companies using selective enforcement to justify these reductions in headcount Yes and also I would like to say that those last two I actually think might have been a little bit justified And we went back and forth Kayla hates fantasy football It's not necessarily that but if there are rules for a reason and I'm not saying that meta should have fired these people for misusing these perks Or that EY should have fired these people for whatever they're doing I think it's more like it's it is slippery slope They're fudging the rules on these small things to that being indication of a larger issue with those employees So that being said I do think it's very silly to fire somebody for being a part of fantasy football league But I kind of understand where they're coming from They are rules that they've set they're allowed to like enforce those rules Yeah I mean I think we already talked about voluntary layoffs now we're talking about sneaky layoffs We're going to talk about AI Like under like the word that's pinning all these together is efficiency and even Zuck said like this is the year of efficiency I think we're seeing companies with new tools and with hiring too much during COVID Wanting to write size and finding any way to do that And so if they can find someone that's like broken a company policy They can fire them it looks better from a PR perspective You're not having to do mass layoffs and I think that's what this is all about I think what gets tricky is if you're a if the person running the fantasy football league was like The top performer at that company they wanted to fire them And so I think you're going to get into this place where like some people break the rules and they're given more leeway Some people break the rules and they're not performing well and they're given no leeway And we'll see how that affects overall employee morale Right so when a company's in hiring mode for instance they're happy to overlook those small things But if they're in austerity mode or the year of efficiency mode they might nitpick I believe they remember the employee manual and all of the things that you can't always do Well let's go down that I'm sure a lot of people now hearing that Listen to this are saying what can I do to make sure I don't run a foul of these things You guys have any perspective on what you can do to make sure you're not part of these sneaky layoffs Yeah I mean I think going back to what I said the problem is most people think they're above average So like everyone's probably like oh I'm doing a great job at work it would never happen to me I think be realistic so like don't do something that the company says not to do We probably all do a little bit of that but don't do something egregious But then the second thing is I think you just have to decide do I want to work at a place That legitimately would fire me for doing fancy football for me I'd be like f that like I don't even want to work here like that is super super lame So I think you also just have to come to terms with like do you want to be micromanaged to that degree I personally want it so I think also one of the things that we actually don't know about these sneaky layoffs is how abrupt they were were people warned about this and then they were fired If that's the case then you have you know you're probably fine if you get warned about misuse of the 30 dollar credits Maybe just don't misuse them again and now and you'll be okay But I think for the most part maybe revisit that employee handbook if you're a little nervous And try to reduce your rule breaking If I'm a company and I found someone doing two training videos at once I'd promote the person Like that's like that's efficiency come on The year of efficiency I will need to see both of your fantasy football records to see where your heads at I'm eight and five Oh sure you are All right another topic that you've mentioned and that we've talked about it on Morning Brew Daily a lot Is how many people that are using AI at work Google release this survey where they talk to over a thousand young knowledge workers And 93% of Gen Z respondents said that they were using two or more AI tools a week 93% some of the use cases they mentioned for AI at work were Revising emails taking notes or generating ideas Nearly 90% actually said that they use AI to start a task that felt overwhelming Now our take on this was consider the source Google ran the survey and they obviously have a vested interest in showing that AR products are catching on in the workplace but from where you guys sit give us a broad overview of where you see AI in the workplace is it really a game changer or is it still ways off from affecting people's daily work lives? Yeah, I mean my take is it is a game changer personally I think and I think people forget like the world is an open notes test And so like you should be using every tool available to you and I think there are so many really incredible tools out there now Chat GBT perplexity being a few and Toby you mentioned this like people are using this when they're stuck And I think that is a common thing you find a knowledge work like you're overwhelmed at a task Even having something to prompt to get you started I think it's very effective The thing I think people are hesitant about is they feel like they need to understand how the tool works Or like they need to like learn deep LLM technology to use these tools which you don't you just have to be open to experimenting and trying them So if I was a worker I would definitely be experimenting with AI tools You're tired If you were a worker are you using AI tools you are a worker? Yes, just to remind you I am also a worker and I am not I really don't care about AI so it's tough for me to have a big opinion on this I think when you're using AI tools to get get on stock to help brainstorm to reduce a task fatigue to be more productive great Where I run into issues is when it's used to communicate to other people and then it's very obvious that AI has been used to me And I think to other you may be potentially hiring managers That's a signal that you're not thinking very deeply to at least try to mask the fact that you use AI in the first place So that's one of the things I think we might see a backlash of in 2025 There does seem to be somewhat of a stigma as you mentioned around communicating using AI And you got an email and you're like this was so obviously Exactly ChatGPT Redduse think that will go away I mean as these tools become more popular you know one of the other findings in the survey that stood out to me was that More than 50% of the people of the Gen Z people that they surveyed said that they freely talk about their AI use at work And they're not shy about it like maybe some older workers are so they're talking about it They're blatantly using AI and they're proud of it I think human in the loop is still very important I mean even thinking about like the Morning Green newsletter for example Like an AI could write that and AI could curate the news but what makes Morning Green newsletter so special is the tone It's witty, it's smart, it's a reverent, it's funny And right now I don't think AI can emulate that and I think people still love communicating with other people So I think when you're doing some sort of communication that goes to an external person They want to feel like you actually care It is a sign of respect to like I put effort into this email And that's going to get their attention I think to Kayla's point when it's obviously AI People feel like okay I'm just getting 100 spam emails a day now They're all AI I don't really care So external facing communication I think a human should still be in the loop Internal efficiency I think AI should be used all the time So you know Kayla doesn't use AI but I'm just listening you know I'm hearing this survey as a regular person who's working in our current workforce And I'm seeing that 93% of Gen Z leaders, they surveyed leaders and future leaders aspiring leaders These people who are very motivated to get ahead and I'm seeing that 93% are using AI I would just say to people who aren't using AI is that should I just light a fire under my butt or am I okay You know kind of living in an AIless world Yeah sometimes I kind of feel like somebody before the internet being like why would I use the internet when I have books So I could be wrong and I will let's revisit this in December of 2025 The one thing I will say is a lot of AI you are using AI It's just built into the existing tools you're already using So I think also asking people are you using AI? Depends on if they recognize that like Google already has AI built into the product Auto complete stuff like that So I think everyone is using AI just not everyone knows they're using AI I will give you a little feather in your cap Kayla because you've been getting ganged up on in this segment This is Slack, Slack ran this larger survey they talked to 17,000 workers across multiple countries And they found that overall across all ages AI use in the workforce was actually stalling out a little bit So perhaps it was a more international survey talked to just a wider range of people not just these young hungry knowledge workers So you could be right that maybe it isn't vibing with a lot of people's workflows Maybe they've had bad experiences with that So I'm just giving you a little bit of back of your game Thank you I appreciate it You're not alone out there I want us to talk about the hottest three letters in higher education MBA Many people listening to this might be at the point in their careers where they're considering whether to go to business school or not And more and more young workers are saying I'm in after two years of declines Applications for business schools spiked 11% between 2023 and 2024 That's according to a recent survey by the Graduate Management Admissions Council The Tippytop B schools on even bigger surge in applications Columbia up 27% Northwesterns Kellogg up 23% University of Chicago booth up 22% Harvard Business School up 21% It's huge double digit increases across the board driven by Americans rather than international students And people are searching for the full immersive MBA experience rather than evening part-time classes Applications for full-time in-person MBAs jump 32% to their highest level in a decade So Kyle and Kayla I'd love to hear your take on why we're seeing such a rise in MBA applications And what you think it says about the current state of the job market Yeah, I think it's all connected Right, so we've been talking about sneaky layoffs back door layoffs If these knowledge workers, tech workers are getting laid off and don't necessarily see any prospects in the job market It makes sense that they're looking for ways to strengthen their resume And typically, I guess I don't have exactly the data on this, but typically the idea is when you see expected declines in the economy These graduate degrees or additional degrees, additional credentialing will increase So I'm not surprised that you're seeing that at the same time What I'm surprised by is the fact that I'm also seeing anecdotally An increase in distaste for hiring people with MBAs And just a few months ago we did an episode on if you should get an MBA And one of the stats that we saw was actually that people who graduated from the Harvard Business School, which is one of those tipy top business schools that you mentioned We're having a vast increase in unemployment Six months after graduating, I believe it went from like 7% unemployment to like 23% unemployment, something like that So I'm curious what's going to happen when this next batch of increased students graduate Yeah, it's interesting too, it's also a bit of supply and demand, so I think in a vacuum, I would say like most people see an MBA, they're like, oh that's good But if more people are getting an MBA, and you're now feeling more candidates with MBAs, you still have to find a different way to stand out to a hiring manager So it'll be interesting to see after this batch goes through the process, if they're actually lucky enough to get a job I think really what underpins this is people don't like to go home on the holidays or whatever and see their aunts and be like, I'm not working It's so much easier to be like, well I'm getting an MBA on Pam And so I think there's a bit of this like, you feel stuck, you're not sure where to go And an MBA is a convenient off ramp to like feel like you're doing something and to figure out what you want to do next in your career I think also we're in a period of pretty rapid technological change We talked about AI, there's a lot of other things happening from clean energy to machine learning that's part of AI Data analytics is becoming, there's new fields popping up every single year and so something that might be going into applicants' minds is I would love to level up my game in these various fields and be a leader in this space But I don't really have the skills or the knowledge set to do it right now And I go to get an MBA and become an AI data science person And I'm just looking at the trend line here and I'm seeing, wow, they're probably going to be hiring a lot of employees, a lot of leaders in this space going forward So it might be an opportunity to learn more about the changes that are happening pretty rapidly in our labor force It's really interesting Neil though because as you said like, as new fields get developed more and more rapidly I feel like a two-year program should actually become less relevant and you'd want to focus on really quick bits of learning that are hyper relevant to the scenario you find yourself in right now Because you started an MBA program in two years, there's like a hundred new fields that didn't exist when you started So that's an interesting counter trend and we'll have to see how it plays out Well hiring for roles that require bachelor's degree drop below 2019 levels in recent months So I think that stat has a lot to do with what we're saying I think some Silicon Valley people and some founders just cringed at the fact that Neil said Best way to get ahead in these emerging fields is to go get an MBA in it No, the best way is probably to go and like actually work in the field to go do research and stuff like that So I definitely do think if you can get a job If you can, or just the whole reason you can't get a job you have to go establish your credentials You can't just say, hey, I'd love to get an I'd love to be your AI CEO And they'll be like, you don't know nothing about that, go to school and they're like, okay Neil, I would the way I got the job is by literally say, hey, give me the job not credentialing it that way But you're not working in data science That's true Personally, I would love to be an AI CEO, so if anyone's hiring, just let me know I'm going to come up with that There you go All right,

ALPS distributors in All right, they say good artist copy, but great artist steal So to finish off this episode, we're going to steal a segment that you guys do on your show called M.I. the A-hole Like you, we asked our listeners to submit some instances where they've butted heads with a coworker Or beefed with a boss with the hopes that you guys can help them choose who the A-hole is in the situation We changed the names from some of these submissions to help protect anonymity, but are you guys ready to dive in? Yes, and we have not heard these ahead of time. So these are live reactions Yes, off the cuff. This one is from Brooke I was once in a meeting with all men when one of them started to curse, but then stopped themselves and said, Sorry, I shouldn't curse when there's a girl in the room. Is he an A-hole or is he just being considered? I'm going to go give him an assignment that's not even part of this A-hole, that's cringe I'll go full cringe It's 2024, that's A-hole, that's A-hole behavior Women swear, okay, that's crazy, I'm so sorry Brooke, they are the A-hole Yeah, I mean, that's just showing that you're getting treated very differently based on your gender I think that's just swear That sounds like discrimination I think that is probably true, a lot of, I mean, a lot of the women I know swear more than I do I'm just even hearing that made me cringe like that All right, moving on, this one is from Brooke Recently at work, I was given a shoulder tap job opportunity within my company AKA, if I wanted it, they would give me the promotion I spent a lot of time getting to know the team and other teams this role has a part in All the conversations went extremely well and I was getting excited I accepted the offer and waited three weeks for the written offer to be sent back, no response I asked for a follow-up which turned into a 15-minute conversation about revoking the offer, saying things like, it's not you, it's us I called my director and they were equally as ticked off I also decided to email the president directly and I the A-hole for escalating this potential promotion that went south I wanted this is the same Brooke, you've had a tough goal, so I apologize I don't think that's person's A-hole at all, I mean, I think they were put in a tough situation They're kind of promised something, it didn't pan out And you should use every tool available to you to make sure that it comes to the conclusion You want, which is you ultimately do get that job I would say even if they were like, okay, we'll give it to you, it's probably not a good scenario It's like, once someone shows you who they are, believe them Sounds like this company kind of pulled the rug on you And I would start trying to find something else To what point do you push? When do you stop? Well, I think once they've reneged on the offer, it's and it seems like everyone is upset I think it's time to say, okay, clearly this is not a fit for some reason It's time to start looking, I don't think you even have to message the president I mean, I would push, I would try to get the job and see how it goes But in the back of my head, I'd be like, even if I get it, I'm going to start evaluating my options elsewhere Because again, the company promised me something they didn't come through This probably is in the first time or the last time it's going to happen And I'd be a little more weary going forward Is this one of those tough love scenarios though, or if you don't get it in writing, then it wasn't actually an offer Is Brooke here just being naive in this case? I don't think so, I mean, I think personally for me, I wouldn't want to work in a place where they're like, we didn't technically give that to you in writing Even though we promised it to you, so legally we don't have to give it to you I just wouldn't want that, you told me I was going to get something, I put in all the work I didn't get it What I will say is because it's internal, I agree with that If it was external, I don't think you should believe anything until you see it in writing Because they have, they're not already employed with that It's the internal part that's like, alright, you give us your word like that What seems the most wrong about the company's behavior here is the communication They didn't communicate with Brooke about why the offer was pulled in the first place And then they said, it's not you, it's us Some clear explanation about saying like, okay, well we thought this job was going to be available but things changed And the job is not available so we still value as employee blah blah I mean, I have done that, I have put out a job application before that people applied to And then actually like the position we decided not to go through with it So to email a lot of people and be like, we're actually changing gears our strategy So I had to explain about why the job, you know, why the job they applaud for wasn't available And that wasn't fun but I just tried to over-communicate Yeah, I mean, treat people like adults and communicate clearly as soon as you know And this issue doesn't happen It is so wild how this all feels like relationship vibes If you just flip some words around company instead of company you do girlfriend or boyfriend So this is very helpful for a lot of people in that sense Yeah, me and Kayla are actually going to launch a relationship Yeah, basically you already have Alright, our final question from our audience is how can I gracively handle being promoted from within I am newer to the team and younger than my colleagues And I'll be their manager starting next week The transition feels difficult to navigate as I want to maintain existing friendships While also taking our team in a new direction So not really a MI, the A-hole scenario here Just some advice on how to deal with a promotion into a team full of her friends Yeah, sounds like nobody's the A-hole here so we love that My advice here is that it's going to be really challenging Especially if it's you know you're a group full of your peers And then all of a sudden you're managing them I can completely understand why that's going to be tough And so my recommendation is to completely over communicate Explain the awkwardness, name it, call it out Allow your new direct reports to express any discomfort to you directly so that they don't harbor resentments And that basically will open up a clear channel of communication for the future And hopefully we'll make your bonds and relationships stronger moving forward Yeah, I think that's a brilliant answer. I mean name it to tame it is the saying we use often Like it is going to be awkward and it's going to be a challenge if you go from a colleague to a manager of your friends So have that conversation Ultimately if you're able to help them grow in their career and help them achieve the success they want to work They're going to love you as a manager And so I think the hard part internally after you name it to tame it is kind of getting into that manager role And understanding it is not all about you now. It's also about growing your direct reports And that really matters to them if you can prove that you're going to grow in your friendship in I think unique ways too Is it a scenario though where you have to kind of put your manager hat on and then take it off And then put your friendship hat on and take it off or should you try to maintain kind of a consistent persona Throughout the friendships and throughout the work environment or should you be kind of code switching here and there I don't know what your take is Kayla. I do think like the relationship dynamic will change Like when you go from just a colleague in a friend to a manager in a friend You're your responsibilities to that person do change in like almost like a legal way like you in the hierarchal way So I think it will change and it'll probably change the nature of your friendship a little bit And that's just realistic but I think that's what you get when you accept that role Yes and I think that it might be helpful to say like I'm putting on my manager hat now And I have to give you hard conversation and that could or hard hard advice That could give you a little bit of like alter ego mindset Where I'm now the manager and therefore I can give you this this difficult feedback All right well sadly we do have to wrap it up there. Kyle and Kayla. Thanks so much I think this is an awesome discussion. I mean I was 25% of it So they would have been great. Where can people find you if they want to listen to per my last email? We're on every platform out there just type in per my last email to your AI powered search engines Yes and it'll not even know But definitely listen to them in the year forward because they'll talk about all these really interesting work issues that are happening in 2025 That we previewed here but also ones that emerge that we don't even know yet And maybe a little relationship Don't give them any ideas Okay for any questions comments or feedback on this particular show send an email to Morning Brew Daily at MorningBrew.com Let's roll the credits Emily Mill iron is our executive producer Raymond Lut is our producer Michaela Heck is per my last emails producer who helped out on this show Thanks so much Olivia Graham is our associate producer Yuchenoa Ogu is our technical director Billy Minino is on audio hair and makeup defected to their podcast Okay Devon Emory is our chief content officer and our show is a production of Morning Brew Great show today everyone let's run it back tomorrow Wait wait before you go Neil has one more thing to tell you It's time to calm a clean hosting Morning Brew Daily isn't my only job Wait are you Batman?
