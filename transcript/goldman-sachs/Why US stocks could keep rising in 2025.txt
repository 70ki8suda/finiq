 The Fed cuts and stocks sink. What's the trade from here? This is the markets. I'm Chris Hussi with Goldman Sachs Research and this week I'm joined by Ashok Faradhan, co-head of Goldman Sachs Global Banking and Markets. Ashok, thanks for joining us. Thanks for having me. It's fun to be here and it's a good timing, right? It's terrific timing because we're taping this three hours after the Fed release at statement this week. What are your initial reactions is the Fed now ahead of the curve? I really wasn't that surprised. I think on the trading desk we had a little bit of a different view than our economics group. Our feeling was they would sort of inelastically recalibrate rates lower in 2024. We thought that would be 100 basis points. Obviously that didn't come 25 basis points four times in a row. You had one move of 50 and then two subsequent moves of 25 basis points each. Now they're at 4 and 3-8s. That's still restrictive by any metric in terms of where underlying inflation is and where you ultimately think the neutral rate is, but it's not that restrictive. Therefore, the bar for subsequent cuts is going to be higher, especially since economic output continues to be very formidable. You're going to grow this year at above 2.5%, which by most measures is above trend growth. And inflation has come down a lot and we've made a lot of progress, but it's still a ways from their 2% goal. So why not move more gingerly from here? As you point out, they have taken a little bit more of a gradual approach here. Now looking for only two cuts in the year ahead, we had been expecting three markets had been pricing as much as four earlier. What does that mean? A slower pace of cuts. What's that mean for markets? I think, again, what those dots reflect is just sort of the median aggregation of all the members forecast. And who knows, you know, the realization could end up being no cuts, the realization could end up being four cuts. Obviously, that's going to be very data dependent. But certainly, in our view, we felt like that had to gravitate to less cuts, given the pace of economic data that we've seen coming in. And so I think the market is making, frankly, a little bit too much of it. Obviously, we were in a place where the market had run up a lot, subsequently the election and obviously concurrent with some of the better economic data. And so we were vulnerable. And it just turned out that we today were vulnerable to an expectation of three dots being two dots, but I wouldn't read too much into it. Let's unpack that place where we are because equities are trading at a peak of about 22 times. A lot of corporate credit carries practically no spread at all. 10 years stuck above 4%, it's climbing even higher. Are you worried about valuation here? Or do you think markets will keep trading that US exceptionalism, that GDP growth that we expect for 2025? So I'll start by saying in the risk business, you always worry about valuation. How can you not worry about valuation if something is expensive or you think something is high, you worried about gravity, and if something is low, you think about all the reasons for why it's low. And you can rationalize the price being there. So I'd start by saying, in the markets, we always worry about valuation. That being said, when you think about the public markets, and in particular, the companies that are driving the valuation in public markets, their extraordinary companies with the market leading position, producing extraordinary earnings, but with a lot of capability to buy back stock. And so there's a story there where one, you could argue that the equity risk premium associated with those marquee names should be waning, coupled with the fact that they're still growing in such a way that they can grow into their valuations. And so I don't worry about valuation here more than any other time in my life, which is all the time in terms of worrying about valuation. As it relates to US exceptionalism, I don't see why that trend should stop. In terms of that's something that's been underway for a long period of time. If you look at how global stock markets have grown, the US has been an absolute out performer. And we can sit here in detail all the reasons why it's better to do business here than necessarily in other jurisdictions. And certainly if you look at an administration that's coming in that wants to be a little bit more protectionist as it relates to American companies and American industries, there's no reason to think why that can continue. Yeah, as you point out, the administration literally has an America first agenda. So you would expect that to carry over to markets. And we just held our financial services conference last week in New York. There was a lot of talk about how capital markets are poised to finally pick up in 2025. Oh, pinning that a little bit, because is there a cyclical pick up here on the come or are you worried about all that private markets have stolen from the public markets a little bit here? I mean, private markets have definitely taken share. Certainly if you look at the capital formation that exists and that has grown around private markets, that's an ecosystem onto itself. That capital formation for lack of a better description doesn't force things to necessarily come to the public markets perhaps in a way before that they would have to do that. But I believe that you will see and you've already seen at this year equity capital markets activity picked up, you know, debt capital markets picked up a lot. I anticipate that to continue, especially as you have again, rates that have normalized 100 basis points lower, easier financial conditions, pro cyclical policies in the administration. I think all of that will lead to higher capital markets activity, higher levels of M&A, which are coming off of, you know, still historically lower levels. And so I think as it relates to the banking channel, I think things are on the rise. Yeah, and of course, even if we only get those two cuts that the dots are talking to rates are still going to be going lower and so that's going to be a nice way. Sure, certainly relative to what we experienced, right? I mean, in 2022 and really all of 23, really not until I guess not until the onset of the fourth quarter of this year, we're hovering around five and three eights. And so that's certainly going to be a relief. Yeah, very different place in where we were back then. Oh, okay, let's cut to the trade. What do you like here? Where do you want to be positioned? You know, obviously I gave the talk for US equities. I think who knows you can ebb and flow. I like my entry point today at the end of the day better than it's beginning of the day. But I think US equities will poise to be higher. If I think about the US and I just think about sort of the high level macroeconomic parameters, which is, you know, ongoing fiscal support, we can talk about whether that's going to increase or decrease. But I think the fiscal support will continue to aid the economy. Normalization of interest rates, those two things together should be a good cocktail for full employment or close to full employment and healthy levels of growth. And so I think you want to be in US stock. So that would be first and foremost. And then I would say on the value side, there are some things in the emerging markets that are starting to look interesting. I think Brazil has cheapened up a lot and has been under a lot of pressure over the course of the last few months. And so I would look at some of those things too, because as you get more normalization in the US and more calm in the US and a resumption of normalcy, you just start to see some of the things on the periphery participate as well. Yeah, it's a great point. Brazil rates going in the opposite direction, but that partly because their economy is going so strong. Now, do you want to be hedge or unhedge? Earlier you said you're a risk manager. Is this a year in which you want to be more hedge than usual? I don't think so. I think one of the things, you know, there are many different ways to risk manage. I think one way is obviously to think through not having any beta and just thinking about all the different alpha exposures you want to have. Another way is to say, okay, I want to have this beta, but what's my tolerable loss? What is the tolerable loss? I'm willing to incur that sort of been my mantra, certainly over the course of the last couple of years, and that'll be mine going into 2025. Okay, last question. Take yourself back to your childhood. Yeah. What was the best present you ever got as a kid? I think it was, I mean, it wasn't around Christmas. I was born and raised in New York City and around the time where I don't know if they do it anymore, but you step something called Bat Day at Yankee Stadium. And so my dad, you know, I would like always anticipate my dad getting Yankee tickets so we could go to Yankee game and not only what I go to the game, but I get a bat that I would be able to use for the summer. So that's sort of that's why it was the greatest thing in the world. Bat Day at the stadium. I remember that as well going with my dad. Yeah. No better day. Yeah. Bat Day and Cap Day were two of the great days of Yankee Stadium. Ashok, thanks so much for taking the time with us today. Thank you. That does it for this week's episode of the markets.
